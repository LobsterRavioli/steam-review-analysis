180207867,"(TL;DR) Fun and rewarding game that is a great in the horde survival genre. --- Watched some gameplay of this a long time ago and thought it looked fun, something like They Are Billions. I was right with what I thought, the game is a blast to play and pretty easy to pick up, coming from someone who doesn't frequent the genre very often. The difficulty was pretty extreme early on but now that the game is fully out, it seems to be a lot better. The building is fun, exploring and fighting with your troops is rewarding, the challenge modes and infinite mode are awesome, the campaign (from what I played so far) is good, and lots more to love. The whole game is fun for anyone who's looking for a game to occupy the horde survival/RTS spot in their library. --- Would heartily recommend buying it or waiting for a sale for those who're unsure.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.7208799123764038}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9212326407432556}]"

180191902,"This is a simple game, which can make it enjoyable. But there doesn't seem like there's much fluidity or flexibility in terms of strategy. I also feel the game is unbalanced. Playing on Endless, the difficulty ramps astronomically, and there's really no way to tell what you're in for. But the worst part is not that -- its the irritation of having dead bodies returning from the grave to attack your buildings, or the random single enemy that comes out of nowhere. Because the sprites are so small, it can be very difficult to tell where you're being attacked Overall, I just didn't find it very enjoyable, even though I think a lot of the elements are here.

Or rather it was. This game is not for casuals or anyone not willing to invest hours per mission and optimize. The difficulty on ""A walk in the park"" is brutal. The missions require extensive micro play and need to be played optimally: Build order, rushing of specific upgrades, spamming specific units, doing specific tasks in order. If you imagined a quaint army builder / tower defense were half the joy is to watch the epic battles, prepare for disappointment. You'll be busy snowballing your economy to try to stay ahead of the difficulty curv..cliff. There is a reason why the achievements have such low completion rates. The tutorial alone will weed most people out. I understand that once somebody figures out the meta, the missions become trivial. Herein lies the problem of the game. It is either too hard or too easy with a hard lean towards the former. I hated multiplayer in Northgard - because you had to rush, had to do things in one specific optimal way or get stomped by the opponents.

179839219,"I *would* recommend the game, but it's a very marginal pass. They game becomes tedious fast, and i'm not even sure i'm halfway through. It's cutesy and fun as a colony-building, resource managing game, but it's also easy to lose track of your workforce because halfway through a map they start sucking resources dry really fast. That's one of my main problems with the game; it's GREAT at first when the numbers are small, but then you are asked to macro manage with micromanaging mechanics. That's not a lot of fun The same can be said about the fighting. It's fun and quantifiable at first but then the enemies start zerging you, and it's hard to keep track of all the variables or have proper management of the situation set up. On top of that, there's really no new unlockables. There *is* the option to change factions multiple times throughout the game which also branches out the storyline, but there are no ""upgrades"". Other similar strategy games (like Kingdom Rush, or TAB) have progress upgrades that unlock new/stronger equipment in later stages. Moreover, you do not have access to all of your assets from the beginning; the games limit you to certain units /towers at first which become stronger and more specialized as the game goes on. Here... neither of these happen. All your assets are available from mission one, and achievable from as soon as mission two. That stagnates the game, whose hours-long missions end up feeling tedious and tiresome. I like what is going on at first and I admire the effort that went into the branching campaigns. The scenes in-between missions are also very fun and give the game its own unique character. That said, i do feel tired after having played the missions; the game is a near-hit for me.

178701276,"Don't be fooled by good artsyle and nice base mechanics - this game is horrible in what matters the most. Level design and tools it gives for the job. Campaign (Main chunk of content here) relies on YOU assaulting enemy bases (Compared to trailers which show you defending yourself from enemy forces). There are a few defense missions, yes, and they are the best. For assaults though... Let's give you some simple math as example. Trebuchet, a legendary siege known to most fans of medieval games. Enemy towers in last mission have up to 3000 HP (Range is about between 1200 and 3000). So you think ""Well, it is trebuchet time"". Only that... Trebuchets deal 45 damage per impact. 45 (!). So, to destroy *a* tower you need around 67 shots from trebuchets. And final level is full of these towers. And enemy will retaliate in the mean time, hell, good chance their own siege engines (With higher damage) will counter your trebuchets. And it is just an example of missions where you are the attacker. Game has plenty of tools for defensive playstyle, but barely for attacking. And there is planty of attacking to be done. Okay, you say. Then you still can micro all of these, right? No, you can't. Pathfinding and target finding is this game are worse than in Starcraft 1. Simple example - if you give attack move command, your units will attack empty walls and buildings, even if enemy units are around. Target priority ""units > buildings"" was solved decades ago for RTS, what is this? But then you might say ""well then, just manually click what you want to attack"". Only that units will always choose worst path for attacking, they will stack in each other, blocking attack pathes for on another. Overall, it is very *frustrating* experience.

178642670,"What a wonderful game! I'm always down for a new RTS, this is very reminiscent of They Are Billions, only in a lighter more comedic tone with less OP individual units. It definitely scratches the itch for RTS mixed with Tower Defense. I highly recommend it, So you'll understand the loop: there is no ramp up through the campaign for new buildings or anything, it's always an individual race to level up to the third building level and create large defense obstacles between ""mountains"" to push enemies into small areas so you can use your god powers to wipe them out, your units are nominally stronger than the enemy but their numbers can quickly overwhelm you. Usually though you can usually take your time to do just upgrade at ""leisure"" with regular bandit raids throughout depending on your difficulty. The harder levels can be quite brutal though! The campaign doesn't have any special player buildings or considerations aside from enemy building/unit types, but there are some interesting wrinkles on a few of the missions that keep it fun and interesting. Also the comedy is well done if occasionally grammatically incorrect. The visuals are quite nice, I personally have some fairly robust computers so I've never had any issues with too many sprites or system lag, but I'm not sure about older systems. It's pretty cool to have a few thousand enemies attacking you though, I thoroughly enjoy setting up my 50 man squads behind walls loaded with archers and siege weapons.

It is is in a decent state, but not perfect. I hadn't had any crashes so far, but the pathfinding of the settlers has bricked quite a few times, when the settlement got bigger. The campaign is fun so far, I have played through it about halfway this far. To those people that complain about the difficulty, I get where you are coming from. I don't think, that the game itself is too hard, but it does a pretty bad job of teaching you to scale up your base. I had to watch a video of people playing an the hardest difficulties, to see their build order. After that, it became the ""walk in the park"" it promised, but this should be tought through gameplay and not by watching other people. A fix for that could maybe be a small prologue campaign that serves as an extended tutorial, that forces you to build larger economies. Right now, the fourth (if memory serves right) mission of the campaign, where you have to build those boats, is the first mission, where you have to expand to townhall lvl3, having to use the market and whilst beeing under pressure, Which results in quite a difficulty spike, until you have figured those mechanics out. The fact, that the maps are randomly generated, doesn't really help with it, when you are already struggling with figuring out your build order and then also having to adapt it to the maps surcomstances on the fly. I understand, why that is but maybe give an option to play with a fixed seed on lower difficulties? All in all a fun game, when you have figured out how it works. that ""Figuring out"" process is needlessly frustrating, but the game still has a lot of potential to get even better, then it already is.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.617120623588562}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5779833197593689}]"

The missions are long (~4h) and have branching paths and maps are randomly generated so there is high replay value. I think I won't finish my first campaign run at least until I am 80 hours in. Even though the game markets itself primary as a tower defense survive the hordes type game, there are objectives that force you to be the attacker while also still keeping the hordes in check (depending on the game mode ofc) and i really like those gameplay shakeups. Like having a boss mob with a high pool of health to kill (don't skip the concert :)). The story doesn't take itself too seriously, but still manages to be engaging and good fun. The only gripe I have is that I am unsure what the difficulty settings affect (only enemy spawn rates? maybe also map generation?). The campaign also ramps up difficulty by default the more you progress but some general tooltip that explains each difficulty mode changes would be nice. So far I gathered that it affects the number of objectives to complete later campaign missions, the size of the hordes and your starting resources/army. I will stick to the medium difficulty going forward I guess. If you are on the fence, I suggest giving it a try. So far this is a 9/10 for me and RTS type games don't usually click for me.

Anyone giving this game a bad review becauase of the difficulty are just looking for the easy way out and dont understand that your not meant to win first time everytime learning from your mistakes and trying again is half the fun in this game GREAT WORK DEVS HOPE YOU DO SIMILAR WORK ON ADD EXPASIONS IN THE FUTURE,"[{'label': '5 stars', 'score': 0.48547518253326416}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.7319755554199219}]"
177337439,"Great fun. Campaign has good diversity of mission goals and formats. It's not all just build up your base and defend. Some are more offensive, another where you guard a moving caravan. I'm enjoying the campaign a lot. It has points early on where you can choose a side. I think there are three available in the game currently(including the king). There are cut scenes between missions that have humor that I enjoy, but others might find annoying. The game also has challenge modes and endless maps.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.7880608439445496}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.930548369884491}]"
177336225,"I was pleasantly surprised with this game, i had no expectations and hadnt seen clips of it beforehand. Started off my campaign and as I love suffering I chose ""ultra-hardcore"" as my difficulty to commit too (difficulty 3 of 5, not too crazy). Game does a fair enough job explaining how to play until it all of sudden on mission 4 you find yourself in the deep end which was a lot of fun but did require a reload. JUST as i started thinking it may be a bit to shallow for my taste, the next mission had a whole set of new perimeters, units, and game play! Its really cool that the game gives you choices that totally change your campaign experience and allow for a fair amount of replayability, and I really look forward to what the devs add next! Its not that often where modern games force you to figure stuff out on the fly and cause you to have to use actual STRATEGY to win, but this game is tough enough to make you work for it! *TIPS - even the campaign is on randomly generated maps so feel free to restart missions if you find yourself off pace and getting overwhelmed, it'll feel like a new attempt without cheesily letting you know too much about the map to make it easy. EASILY worth $30, maybe more and looking forward to new playable factions in the future!","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.6601353287696838}]","[{'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.963058352470398}]"

177319624,"By now, this game was definitely worth its cost for me :) Supported in Early Access, enjoyed the challenge missions and dabbled a little into endless mode before release. It took some time to get used to the amount of scaling and micromanagement needed in DINAO. The campaign is enjoyable, has some twists and turns and a variety of paths with different missions depending on your decisions. So far the missions are pretty balanced IF you have some experience in DINAO. I am having a very good time with this game! I saw a lot of people getting stuck on a difficulty spike at the 4th mission, mostly due to slow progress in the early game (Day 1-10) which apparently got pretty frustrating. Looking back I agree that there could've been more easing in or directly teaching the necessity to scale properly. Overproduction and rapid population growth are key in DINAO.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.788366973400116}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9290958046913147}]"

Cutscenes are incredibly slow and boring with barely any animation, Building jingles are all pretty annoying, and I suspect there might be some light asset flipping going on here.

After every few days a wave of enemies will come and attack your base and the waves get harder and harder the more days that pass. This wave defending mechanic happens passively along side the main campaign objective so there is some urgency built in.

It can feel overwhelming and unfair at times - but that spurred me on to get better and more efficient, making the feeling of accomplishment genuine and satisfying as hell! the city building mechanics/options are genuinely great in their own right - stacked on top of a tower defense design that elevates everything to a whole other level. after 20+ hours i havent even experienced of those Lord of the Rings style mega-battles - because im still trying to protect my base from utter implosion from smaller waves coming from all sides. those large battles were the reason i was so intrigued by the game to start with. So the fact that im still yet to even reach them is just another reason to keep playing and see just how good I can get. hard recommend. original review at around the 8 hr mark: This game is wildly underrated.

177232944,"I hate to say it but I cannot recammend this game, even though I'd love to as a fan of base builders. The game is just too tedious. It takes forever to gather resources, making base building slow and cumbersome; all the while you're being attacked by stronger and stronger waves. Some mission goals for resources are insanely high as well. Upgrading townhall from level 1-2 takes 150 wood. From 2-3 takes 600, in addition to stone, iron and money. The timing on cutscenes is also really bad, to the point were I just started skipping all of them, even though there is come good comedy. Imagine you're having a conversation with someone but they only speak one sentence every 4-5 seconds but maintain eye contact with you the whole time. The game's pacing needs serious work and now that it's 1.0 I doubt it will improve. If you're a huge fan or wave games or base builders *maybe* give it a try, if it's on sale. If you're on the fence, don't waste your money. Good concept, poor execution.","[{'label': '2 stars', 'score': 0.6041597127914429}]","[{'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.5935307741165161}]"

Mainly: - one lone zombie that's very hard to see won't wreck your entire game - No lame/repetitive single hero control missions with item hunting. - Audio is far less annoying - The PTSD inducing existential dread is far cumbersome. Some negatives I would love the devs to address: - Kiting enemies still works extremely well but is just annoying and time consuming to do. even more so since there is no shift-click pathing option. I wish kiting enemies wasn't helpful and part of the core harder difficulty gameplay. - I wish the military units were better at auto picking up nearby items/drops on the map. Again, just really annoying have to take one unit and tell them to go pick up the thing again and again. I swear 1/10 clicks I either click right next to the thing and find the guy just standing there touching the item but they didn't pick it up.","[{'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.5404277443885803}]","[{'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.4131113290786743}]"

The battles you will face are awesome to watch as both sides fight to the death by any means necessary. The only downside to the game would be small bugs and lack of control over units.

For example, the other faction will have the ability to spawn 40 guys (top tier) ever 50 seconds on the final king path missions and have to cheese the fight to win. This is not good design at all. To expand, it feels like they did a great job of your units for defense but fail to make your units good for Offense which you need on a lot of missions. I will still recommend the game for the sandbox and other stuff but the campaign is a bit crazy and hard to enjoy if you pick the easier options. Feels like they wanted to make a dark souls RTS base defense story which does not work well. They also need to make enjoying all paths easier. Currently you should save or load auto saves at each choice path. Not a great way to enjoy all the effort and work the team put into missions and cut-scenes.","[{'label': '2 stars', 'score': 0.5637131333351135}]","[{'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.8290067911148071}]"
177020242,"I picked this up 5 days ago and beat the campaign on medium difficulty (""Ultra Hardcore"") tonight. As an avid RTS gamer in my 30s, who gravitates towards playing every game at the highest difficulty, I'm glad I read some posts on the Reddit first and stuck to medium. Man, it was hard. My favorite thing about this game is how it constantly challenges your expectations. Much higher difficulty than your average game. Really off-putting pacing in the cut scenes, just for fun. Unique art style, interesting take on translations, and little eccentricities everywhere like never showing the lord's face (going so far as to have a blurred face texture on his in-game unit). The game has a lot of character. I'd compare it most closely to They Are Billions, but it plays quite differently. Gone is the annoying challenge of constantly inching your units forward to clear the map, every single map. You might have to do it once or twice, but each mission has different challenges - some are focused on the waves, some are focused on clearing spawners, some are focused on assaulting a fortified position, some have just a single very difficult final wave. It was interesting to need to adapt each time. My biggest complaint about the game is simply the pathfinding AI - units tend to clump up instead of spreading evenly. It's especially annoying with your own units, because it makes them much less effective in combat without micro. But it also feels a little weird that the AI will happily beat on a 5 layer wall directly in front of them instead of just walking around. But to be honest, that's a pretty small complaint given the scope of this game. It's overall quite polished. I really enjoyed my play-through and am looking forward to coming back at a later date to try it again on the hardest difficulty.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.7194013595581055}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.8326547741889954}]"

Some things i would love to see in future updates would be things like ladder enemy's or other units that circumvent walls in different ways or maybe even the ability to dig trenches or moats. I do think it dose need a few more ''bits and bobs"" for late game as things like endless mode have you max tier rather quickly, which is great for keeping the game simple and for shorter rounds but, would love something shiny in later endless mode games like special units or buildings. I also would love to see visual representation of damage to walls and buildings to see them barely standing at the end of the wave or crumble to dust as you get swarmed.

You're constantly punished for playing the game. No matter what strategy or how quickly you secure a position, the next wave will always be harder to deal with than you are ready for. In the 8th mission set on the campaign I have restarted probably 30 times in an attempt to get a favorable starting position and to defend against the next wave. It has not been enough. It is impossible. Mind that I have been playing on the easiest difficulty, and I am no slouch with an RTS. Please adjust enemy health/unit damage. It shouldn't take 3 catapult balls to kill the second from weakest enemy soldier. It shouldn't take 5+ arrows for an archer to kill the second from weakest soldier.

From the little sound cues you get when clicking on buildings, to the different personalities of soldier classes, and the charming art design this team has really separated themselves from just another [insert RTS classic] clone. While taking inspiration from its predecessors, it borrows their best elements and builds upon them tremendously. The city building feels close to perfect for a game like this. My favorite part of games of AoE was building bases and just trying to survive while attacked on all sides and this is pretty much my dream in that regard. Everything feels well calculated to provide enough depth to building and defense without becoming too overwhelming for a game that is as much an RTS as a building game. For future development I would love to maybe see a little more depth to the building system, as it stands right now it is great just not perfect in my opinion.

176913354,"First off, I want to say this game is challenging and fun and I would recommend it, BUT the campaign in its current state is not balanced well to the point that it ruins the experience. I had 30+ hours in the pre 1.0 release so I understood the games mechanics going into the campaign, but I'm at a point (about half way through) where I cannot progress, despite being on the easiest difficulty, as there is not enough time to extract resources so that you can build good defenses. This isn't a problem with just the level I'm currently on either. This has been a reoccurring theme where you have to scramble to set up enough resource buildings so you can build your army large enough to defeat enemy waves that attack from random directions. If you don't get enough resources in time, then you can't build good buildings, and then can't build good armies, and then game will crush you with endless waves of enemies that get larger even if you're struggling to rebuild from the last wave. It's very frustrating when you put hours into building a great city, when it only takes a few small groups of weak enemies, attacking from many different directions, to destroy enough of your buildings so that your resources are drained and are defenseless against the next enemy wave. I really wish I could give a positive review because a lot of effort has been put into this game and at times it is fun to play, but the game is a sweatfest even at the easiest difficulty. I will change my review if the game and balancing is updated, and I really hope it is because the potential to have a really fun experience is there but needs work.","[{'label': '2 stars', 'score': 0.5348265171051025}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44919833540916443}]"

176801302,"Game balance is just way off. Horribly finite resources make building any sort of capable defenses tedious and a considerable struggle. Level 4 was certainly difficult but the levels thereafter are even worse, even after the update. Honestly, the game just isn't fun and needs to be re-balanced, regardless of what the dev might say. My suggestions: - Improve missile AI to better engage targets. Right now, you could have 100 archers shooting at the same enemy and all of the arrows aren't connecting because of the weird positioning. A tower's position along a wall shouldn't lose an entire run because you realized too late all of your arrows will just miss. Is there any real reason for arrow collision other than to frustrate the player? - Resource nodes could use a significant bump. I understand wanting the player to expand to gain resources, but the amount of resources given means you cannot adequately defend any new positions taken. The gold mechanic required to tech up just exacerbates this issue. At the present, I can see resource nodes being bumped by at least 30% and the game still being very difficult. - If resource nodes aren't adjusted, then the gold mechanic is too brutal. Introducing a way to generate gold passively either through a new tax building or node could help the situation and give players a chance to get their economy going before getting overwhelmed. At present, a player is required to dump insane amounts of resources into the market just to get to tier 3, then not be able to afford anything tier 3 has to offer before all of the nodes nearby are dry. - I would say lessening the amount of enemy units should be the last option for balancing, considering the theme of the game. The player should just be given more tools and resources to handle the enemies presented. Buffing player units would be a better solution. Either expand the research upgrades each unit can receive, or perhaps introduce a veterancy system for units to be able to better handle the enemies that they are thrown against, which could buff units based on kills. The fact you could probably implement all of these suggestions and the game would *still* be difficult is a testament to how difficult the game is in its current state.","[{'label': '2 stars', 'score': 0.6073465347290039}]","[{'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.7940852642059326}]"

The fact that even after dropping to the lowest difficulty, I still feel extremely time-gated and advancing slower than required to keep up with the AI has turned the fun into frustration. There needs to be some balancing adjustments done on the difficulty levels. Also, having a line of enemies coming at you as a single wave warning alert only to then have them split as 3-4 paths without any warning is rather annoying and has caused me to reload saves multiple times once I know where they are going to come from. Honestly it's just been easier to start save scumming and rushing down the objective which is not really fun nor strategic.","[{'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.4505608081817627}]","[{'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.7241696119308472}]"

Nothing to say but buy it if you have any interest in RTS games. Now some recommendations for the producers to make it even better. 1: add some new spells. Maybe pick and choose one while upgrading town hall. 2: more variety of maps. Love the maps but some more variety would be fun. More mountainous maps, river maps, etc. 3: MULTIPLAYER. I know this is a long shot but if you could do multiplayer to face opponents that would be so much fun. Love the game so much and already addicted.

I don't hate the starvation aspect of the bug maps but i'm not sure how you're supposed to raise a big enough army to fight the generals and gods that spawn. My solution was to just cheese it with healers and one melee guy but that's just not fun. The god has an aoe which kills all your dudes so you rely on healers to heal one melee dude. That's not a terrible situation but it's boring and you basically 3x speed until the day is over.

Can basically not kite around enemy camps without pausing the game to actually move decently every half a second or so. 2. Units need an Idle option where they can stand there without attacking. If i have any unit literally anywhere and an enemy walks into their line of sight, the unit WILL attack. If it's a ranged unit it will even attack on Hold. What's the point of formations and stuff when your Units don't really care? 3. Better visibility on lone enemies. One or two enemies may not even light up red.

176669265,"I like the bit I played but feel like the game kinda doesn't know what it wants to be, city builder? colony management? tower defence? main thing is that it does non of them well but all kinda meh. I liked building the walls of the city and thinking how i'd defend it but when the enemies came your archers just shoot through stuff and your footmen are just really good compared to the npc (this was the very begining so maybe later it's harder) plus the combat is kinda weird like I'd click my guys to fight but half of them would just stand around while the other half actually fought or they'd ignore the enemies and just attack a hut instead. Building the city was nice it looks nice and its really easy but it does lack in depth and there's no real point in building with any order and you can't place stuff right next to each other or the townfolk would get stuck in the building meaning your city takes up way more room than you think you need. Why have a tech tree/research system? seems kinda pointless, instead just give me better stuff as I upgrade my keep, just seems like something they added because other games have it, doesn't add anything other than an annoying thing I have to check every 2 minutes which add kinda pointless upgrades. The management aspect is really basic, your guys eat food you just gotta have enough each day kinda thing which you get by placing a fishing hut etc.. It's simple and not worth noting for the most part its just really basic. I do think adding the power to shoot a laser from the sky or spawn some guys from hell is also a pointless thing and they're really op,.I do think this game could of focused on actually making good defences a more important thing rather than just lasing every enemy from orbit just seems like a kinda missed chance.

176664715,"I enjoy this game for a number of reasons and love many of the mechanics. However... the absolutely merciless ramp up of the difficulty in the campaign on the 4th mission is insane. I've learned a few things and started to progress a little bit farther but still haven't completed it, even after dropping the difficulty down to the lowest setting. I always get to a certain point where it just seems impossible to fend off the constant waves of enemies from the south while also dealing with the regular hordes of enemies that come less frequently and doing the objectives at the same time. I end up using all of my resources on the first things I mentioned and have nothing left to trade in at an insanely bad exchange rate for gold so that I can build the troops needed to put on the ships. I begin to run out of resources in safe areas and have to build work sites that inevitably get destroyed when the next large wave comes. The time in between waves seems like just enough to recover from the previous one, only to get rewarded with a fresh wave of enemies. I feel like this would be a whole lot better without the constant wave from the south. Then I could actually focus on the other mechanics. Please fix this or ease us into this difficulty better by teaching us more about the mechanics. This is really my only complaint about the game, everything else has been pretty great. I would like to be good at this game but the learning curve is either very steep or it simply hasn't been play tested to make sure you can do it on all difficulties.

No meta progression, early on I stumbled onto the best way to power up my economy and I can't find a valid reason to play differently. 2- Upgrades are bland, boring, uninteresting. I take the same ones every game, as they fall into 'mandatory' or 'useless' categories 3- Siege weapons is where the game turns into a beating. Your siege weapons take forever to take out towers, theirs are exceedingly hard to get to - and the only danger their army will ever present. 4- Bullet sponge (but that might just be a difficulty thing, could be an active decision) but with how clunky melee is you're relegated to mass backline. Which is okay, but forces a unit composition. 5- Unit cost. Again, this is for harder difficulties, but I can't bring myself to buy spearmen when axemen have better upgrades and are way cheaper to produce - even with their situational anti-cavalry status. Maybe it's a unit diversity issue too?

Even on the lowest difficulty level you will face rapidly increasingly powerful hordes until you die, no matter what. Unless you rush to finish your objective before that happen. It is very frustrating to play for a solid hour, just to find that the enemy has scaled up so much that the huge spike in difficulty decimates your whole colony without you being able to do anything about it. It is like you really love ice cream, and while enjoying it someone puts a gun to your head and tell you to push it down your throat in ten seconds or die. Technically you ate an enjoyable ice cream, but like in this game the experience is ruined by the aggressive rushing mechanics. Maybe some people like games with a countdown timer type of level design, but I really dont. I could beat the levels once I realized rushing is the key, but then I did not enjoy the game much. Needs a game mode / level that doesnt scale the attacks so rapidly, so you can enjoy it without being rushed and frustrated. People who like a countdown timer type gameplay and pressure can of course just choose the higher difficulty levels. Will change the review if this is addressed.","[{'label': '2 stars', 'score': 0.6241073608398438}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.38074299693107605}]"

I jump in thinking, “Great, bit of strategy, build a castle, defend it, maybe even have time to enjoy a nice medieval sunset.” But nope. First wave of enemies shows up before I’ve even put the foundations down. It’s like trying to build a sandcastle while a toddler stomps all over it. You barely get a breather. The pace is insane. They should call it Diplomacy is Definitely Not an Option Because You're Too Busy Panicking. I’m sitting there thinking, ""Maybe I’ve done something wrong. Am I missing something? Is there a setting for people who actually want to build a castle before the game turns into medieval Doom?"" Nope, not in the campaign. Even on easy mode, it's relentless. I’m sweating. I’m shouting at my screen. It’s madness. And the thing is, I love strategy games! But this? This feels like they took the stress of real-time strategy and cranked it up to ‘Oh god, why did I do this to myself?’ Then, miracle of miracles, I find out about the sandbox and endless modes. Turns out, if you want a more relaxed experience—where you can actually, you know, build your bloody castle before the world falls apart—they’ve got you covered. Much better. You can chill out a bit, take your time, not feel like you’re constantly under siege. But seriously, the campaign?

Also, It may just be a skill issue, but my whole strategy has been hundreds of crossbowmen and the 30 troop soul knight regiment to clear anything on the map.

176533775,"At first I thought the people complaining about the difficulty spike in the 4th mission, were just not figuring out the game... But once I hit it, and replayed it three times, each time trying something new, I understand. While I am sure I'll get it, the park-walk of the first three missions makes the 4th unnecessarily brutal. And rather than ease the player base into things a little slower and retool the difficulty. The devs have pretty much flipped everyone complaining the finger and said, GET GUD NUB. Seriously. It's such a massive change in tactics and timings that MOST players will struggle enough to get angry... And that's on easy mode. While that is certainly their prerogative, it is hardly conducive to creating good will, nor encouraging. So, I am adding my disapproval, in the form of an official complaint/review.

I actually see this as a unique and smart design element that makes things a lot more interesting. Yes, you roll a map that is really hard in the current scenario, but you can re-roll the level and get something totally different requiring a totally different strategy.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.7869603633880615}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.7193900942802429}]"

During EA melee units were just a source of problems, spreading disease. Now they actually make sense, because of how fast they regen, AND the attacking waves include archers, who prefer focusing units behind the walls, which makes archer spam less viable, or even better, forces you to have melee units to draw fire on them. There are still a few units with limited to no use, like axeman, horseman and footknight (the alternatives are just better), but the game is already in a very good spot. Content wise, campaign is story rich, however the cutscenes could use a button to skip to next animation.

176477849,"I want to lead this by saying I SUCK at RTS games, partially because I am often a lazy gamer. To me, they've always felt like trying to cook dinner while cleaning house and helping someone with homework at the same time while the pets are knocking things off tables. As you may imagine, this game has been kicking my ass. Now, I'm going to recommend it anyway. Why? Because this is one of the very few RTS games that makes me WANT to try harder and get better at working in four places at once. The economy is the right level of complex, the buff buildings make a massive difference without being obnoxious to place, the fortifications are impactful and straightforward, the units on both sides have good variety, and the combat feels fantastic to control and observe. There are obvious and apt comparisons to They Are Billions, but there are some major differences that need to be addressed. Most resource deposits eventually run out, population and food are consumed instead of being static ""capacity"" numbers, the scale of the map and your economy is much larger, and, most importantly to me, the game is actually balanced around losing units and buildings on a regular basis. A group of spearmen will handily hold a breach in the walls, often trading one of their lives for 30 or so rebels or just body blocking while the remaining archers continue shooting. Units are generally cheap and quick to train while still being much stronger than the horde units you'll be facing. I still die much earlier than I should, but I can at least see the solutions to apply next time. Thankfully, it's not just ""click more, faster"" like too many RTS games feel.

176477701,"Right now, no. The balancing is way off on missions. On level 3 the difficult ramps up insanely. As a new player, unfamiliar with the game, it was too much frustration to continue. The first level buildings are upgraded, two new resources are used, a whole host of new buildings come into play and your hit by a constant stream of enemies while trying build up to face the larger waves. Plus, in the forum a similar observation is raised and a dev leaves perhaps one of the most asinine remarks I've seen from a developer (to paraphrase) ""I completed the level on the hardest level and beat it first time"". Well woopie-di-do and lardy dar for you, bucko. A player takes the time to make a valid observation, expressing how there may be a hurdle to new players, and the dev blows them off with that BS attitude. Not everyone is in an indoctrinated acolyte of the Cult of Difficult and maybe, just maybe, the dev could take their observation and consider it as free product feedback rather than launch a ""git gud"" barrage. I like the game, genuinely has funny cut scenes, cute functional graphics, and a solid RTS, but it definitely needs better balancing on levels so far, and the devs attitude stinks if that was their response.

And it's way to rushy for me. The day timer is too short and the constant guessing where the enemy will come from is annoing. The micro becomes very cumbersome just opening gates, closing gates, putting archers in towers, taking them down from towers and send them to another tower. Oh and the cutscenes between missions.

My issues lie exclusively with the combat/npc pathfinding so far as I am already having issues with their pathfinding causing them to get stuck and not be functionally useless until I can unstick them or destroy what they are stuck on. Controlling the combat troops isn't what I would want either as there doesn't seem to be any kind select all and the ability to create seperate groups was ignored in the tutorial. When commanding troops they can sometimes just choose not to move or if you select an enemy who dies they will stand there as if a whole group isn't behind them. I am optimistic about the game as the basis is enjoyable and most of my gripes are probably easily patchable but I was waiting for the 1.0 release specifically to avoid things like this, but I will probably give it more time soon and update if my opinion changes. Update:I've played a bit more now and the issues above all still feel prevalent, I also have becoming irritated with the cutscenes which seem to assume the average player has the reading speed of a decomposing corpse and love extremely long gaps between everything, which ruins what would otherwise be decently amusing scenes. I'm probably gonna keep coming back to it as it gives me nostalgia about halo wars as a kid and their is a good game underneath these issues, but I still can't really recommend it to others YET (I'm choosing to be optimistic despite the games industry regularly proving that to be a dumb choice)","[{'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.5281702280044556}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3938550353050232}]"

This can cause a map to be easy on one play through and then mind meltingley hard on the next. 2. Not always clear how hard a map is going to be - Although there's 1 or 2 maps which are almost always an easy start, it's not immediately clear what you're walking into. This, however, may be down to me being a little dumb/menu blind. 3. The horde is real! You're not going to be going up against the massive numbers and diverse enemies you're seeing right away.

Would be Stronghold series, Age of mythology/ empires, Starcraft, Black and White 1 & 2, then now Diplomacy is not an option. This game reminds me of a new Stronghold game. It has some neat QOL features and mechanics. It is a full blown nostalgic trip and an addiction. I can't get enough of this game right now. Plus the procedural generation is a smart and great replay value. It helps with new tactics or strategies. It changes where resources or enemies may be. It changes the way you think in playstyle. I could say so much more. But it's still early access. So I want to leave room for more. When full release comes. I love the magic system and how upgrades work. I can't stop thinking about it. Even as I'm writing this at work. I just want to play Diplomacy. If you like Stronghold or RTS games. This game is 1000% recommended. I actually plan on picking there other game up too. This company deserves to have high praise. Great game here and one of the best times I've had, since playing Stronghold. I think this and the new Age of Mythology Remake will be getting lots of hours in the coming years. Absolutely a phenomenal time to be had and many hours lost.

171192316,"**Review updated** Buy this game. It scratches a deep itch for gamers. Even the enjoyment I got out of the first 2 hours is worth the asking price. This is pretty clearly inspired by Stronghold, the incredible RTS castle builder from 2001. That's not usually a good thing; Stronghold still runs well, plays well, and looks gorgeous, 23 years later. Few good competitors have come around because of just how incredible Stronghold actually is. Diplomacy is Not an Option takes that as a compliment. It is on par with Stronghold. It is enjoyable through and through, offering a good challenge and progression tree. What really amazes me is how the game focuses on the parts we care about. The layout of defenses is what matters most; resource management tends to be pretty easy.

154875818,"Good casual RTS game that love defence! From a veteran of RTS game, the game has pause/play/speed-up game speed elements that allow players to catch up on their economy and base building delegations. It's centered around base defence PVE style where you defeat waves of a few factioned hordes. Microing units isn't as focused as much compared to base placements and planning your progression towards higher tiers of the game. The unit AI is simple and the command menu can change attack priorities which gives the option to the player in how they want to eliminate opposing units. There are different game modes that tweak the goals and objectives of the game which is really good for players who want to experience the game with altered starting/ending resources and objectives. For casual players who have no prior experience to how RTS games should be played, the game can improve on the tutorials because, in the normal and campaign mode settings, players might not be able to unlock further tiers of technology or even survive long enough in the game, if those new players don't know what to prioritize in the game. Aside from what was mentioned, overall solid defence RTS game.

154762107,"I strongly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in tower defense games and city builders - if you always wanted your city builder to have some pressure or military side to it, this is for you. It's very charming and a fun short session style builder (with speed up mechanics). If you've never tried a game like this, I recommend it. It is a straightforward game that can be easy but has a high skill ceiling. It has a sandbox mode and will have a campaign. If you are a new player to the genre, you can stop reading here. For genre veterans; If you came here from They Are Billions or any similar city builder/tower defender looking for more, I am sad to inform you it doesn't do what TAB does better in any way. Again, I only brushed the surface, but the combat doesn't work as well, the maps aren't as large, and the concept isn't as interesting. The tech tree is very straight forward, there are limited enemy types, and even the method of expansion on the map is less interesting. There's less to do overall in almost every category.

153467515,"I love this game. First off, I enjoyed it for at least 35 hours (some levels can be pretty long but you can easily come back to them later). This satisfies the minimum $1-1 hour ratio, and I haven't even 100% completed all of the challenges. Second, it is essentially a series of sandbox and endless maps (for now), but I am looking forward to the potential of this game. I had 100% completed TAB (They are Billions, a hardcore RTS game), and both games have the same general concept (with random map & enemy horde generation, waves, city-building, etc.). Moreover, I think the medieval route with magic (which definitely should be expanded, with magic units perhaps) and the infection mechanics are great. Third, the point of this game is a challenge yourself by building vast armies and/or defenses to combat massive waves of enemies (do not underestimate your enemies!), so it is more of a fast-paced massive RTS (with a pause button and save mechanics, of course). There is already plenty to do, and the devs are pretty clear and transparent in their updates (which is a great sign). Overall, the game will be pretty enjoyable (and challenging if you like playing Ultra-Hardcore), and I think there is a lot of future potential with the stable base content.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.532783031463623}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9357432723045349}]"

It is really difficult to control melee and ranged as the melee keeps heading towards the closest enemies. Ranged on the other hand won't move at all if there are no enemies in range. I always have to bring back the melees or move the ranged towards my melees so that support them. After trying out a few things, I realised that it is difficult or even impossible to play for a long long time. I tried sandbox XL to see how far I can go, but after having about 1000 citizens, and whilst being able to explore half of the map, the amount of food you can obtain is impossible. The buildings don''t provide enough food even when I will be constantly using the market to gain food. They will always be starving. I think the food really needs to be balanced.

149815227,"Brilliant little addition to the RTS genre, with a lot more meat to it than the cute graphics would suggest. It feels like a spiritual successor to the Stronghold series, as you work to build walls, traps, and a variety of tiny little warriors to defend your ever-expanding economy. Having to feed your troops as well as your citizens makes economic management a careful balancing act, as building too big of an army will create a deadly famine, while focusing too much of your economy will place it in danger of the ever-expanding waves of attackers. The real strength of the game, though, is the graphics. I've seen plenty of games attempt a low-poly style and end up feeling soulless and generic. This one does the opposite - it oozes character and charm. The characters, buildings, and warriors all have beautifully detailed animations, and you can happily spend a good while watching your little smiths tinker away in their forges, your lumberjacks haul logs back from the forest, or a squad of spearmen face off against a horde of peasants. The choice of enemies is similarly delightful. Huge, teeming waves of low-HP attackers make for delightfully satisfying fights, made even better by the physics-enabled impacts that throw them into the air. Even losing the game becomes a visually satisfying experience, as you watch the enemy pour into your base. And somehow, it still runs as smooth as butter - I didn't get any FPS drop even when the waves became colossal. Highly recommend.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.7362571954727173}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4659202992916107}]"

No? just me?..... Aaaaanyway, it seems to me that the devs are going for something like that, and did pretty good at it too, so far. It's quite similar to the games i mentioned earlier but without the clutter and micromanaging of having to balance several diferent factions, tech trees and the like. There's still some of that, enought to make a difference but not that time consuming or annoying. There's also several attacking factions with different aspects to them to keep in mind when defending, etc. All in all, an excellent primary gamplay loop with a lot of versatility but without much depth, and cathartic action that even at its most complacent moments manages to keep you engaged and on your toes. The only real con is that there's not that much variety in general and a few qualities of life improvement can be seen missing here and there, but hey, that's what early access is for.

148418375,1.0 Update The only thing slower than the campaign are the cutscenes! It's like someone soaked the comedic timing in molasses! Besides that it's been quite enjoyable and challenging. Just finished the third mission of the campaign after not playing for at least a year and it has been a good ramp up in difficulty throughout. I could see my self failing that 3rd mission if I didn't basically know what I was doing before hand. The extra mission objectives are a serious plus. Looking forward to the rest of the campaign. RECOMMENDED Don't be surprised if you have to restart a mission or two if you've never played before. Pre 1.0 Been having quite a bit of fun with this one. Play on Endless Mode - Troublesome Valley right from the git go and treat it like a rougelite city builder. Very good.

144229593,"A small, but great RTS/city building game. You start as a small castle with a meager amount of resources, soldiers, and residents; and you must expand your territory through scouting, city-building, resource acquisition/management, technological development, and military might. You must defend your kingdom from hordes that come every few days, and expand into a hostile territory whose occupants only grow in strength the further you venture from your castle. Due to the nature of hordes growing in strength as time goes on, you must research better tech and increase the proficiency/size of your army with every passing day. You must wall off your entire kingdom so hordes can't just waltz on through. Every mode ranges in difficulty, from easy to practically impossible. Once you get used to the game's mechanics, you can play this while listening to music/videos.

144074502,"Well ""Diplomacy is not an option"" is a pretty good RTS, a ""LEGO style ""take-your-time"" version of the awesomely hardcore They are Billions game. If the Diplomacy.. is already enjoyable to play as is however the campaign is only at 10% of its development progress. So most people enjoy the game as is are the people who like to play in the free sandox mode and decide of their own challenge, I am not that kind of person I prefer a campaign. The final release is set for November 2023 but so far the campaign has only 2 missions. For some reason the 2nd and last level available was a massive increase in difficulty on the economic side of things and I wish there was more guidance like a few tips to help me orienting my strategy. I see in that a good and a bad sign, the good: the game is more complex than just having to use the correct unit. The bad: I am fine banging my head on the wall and take the time to find the solution but I know a lot of players who are way healthier than me and would stop playing instead, quick tips or even a small video to guide us to beat the mission would be nice. I definitely like it but then it immediately reminds me of Alien Marauder which for some reason went under the radar of the steam community if you like it here go check Alien Marauder. EA lacks consistency in content update but the game is good without being exceptionnal.

143732237,"Overall this is a great game - mixes elements of Stronghold and They Are Billions games. If you like either or both of those, you'll probably like this one. PROS: 1) Zoom in and out levels are great - high overview and then detail up close is pretty nice. I don't feel restricted in the camera zoom or rotation. 2) Troop formation control is good - simple and intuitive: Mouse drag to set direction while simultaneously using keyboard to select arrangement of your formation, which is basically various sizes of line, block and column. Select guard mode so that your swordsmen stay disciplined in the line to guard your archers. Swordsmen will do their job when enemies get close enough. Developers might want to consider tactical pre-sets for formations too, like hollow square and wedge formations for example. 3) Economy buildings are diverse and interesting, keeping the interplay of resources an important aspect of the game. 4) Tech tree is nice - graphic style is creative. Military units, medical, worker speed, trade, etc. are upgrade choices that you make. 5) Obelisk powers add a nice fantasy aspect to the game - nothing like hitting that mob of ghouls with a meteor! 6) You can have a lot of units and enemies on the battlefield at once. 7) You can choose to build your town and castle walls the way you want. CONS - as of the current Beta version: 1) Attacks come on a timer, and the problem is that sometimes it takes quite awhile to defeat the current wave of attackers. Meanwhile the clock is still ticking and the next wave is on top of you before you have time to repair, rebuild and create more troops. This is frustrating especially if you have just finished an epic defense of your town. The amount of time invested in building up vs. the speedy overwhelming defeat seems unbalanced and not as much fun as if you could eke out the survival of your town and live to fight another day. A simple fix would be to have the timer start after the current battle is over. Or perhaps another possible fix would be to award gems for an epic defense, to use the obelisk powers to defend against the next wave, while you rebuild - so still keeping it challenging, but possible to pull out a win from that next immediate wave.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.7747039198875427}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8900011777877808}]"

142495880,"Gonna have to go ahead and give this one a thumbs down. While there's alot of things I enjoy about it. Even the ""easy"" born to chill mode gets too aggravating. If it's labeled an easy mode and supposed to be chill maybe not have massive waves attacking from both sides every 7 days on wave 4. Mind you days pass very quickly in this game and resources are hard to stay on top of. There's alot of potential here but serious balancing issues. IMO all its missing is more customization for endless mode. Examples such as define how often waves come, the size of them, and how much they increase over time.

Yeah sure, its missing some content, such as more weapons/troops or more defence buildings or traps. Economy and productions is pretty basic and only 5 resources.

141402354,"good simple game that I think pretty much anybody could learn. Despite it being simple. it inspires creativity when focusing with battles and has streamlined the base building aspect enough that you don't really need to pay attention to it when you need to manage troops, which is a good thing. Highly recommend for anybody interested in games like banished and similar. Personal feedback: One thing I think could be very helpful is a tech queue and maybe have the tech button flash when you finish research, I also think maybe having troops level up could be a cool idea but I think that would be better left to a mod if this game ever gets workshop support. I also think having walkways would be nice, as normally in these games they allow people to walk faster along them, and it would also help greatly in visualizing where you might want buildings in the future. In the same vein maybe having a sticker feature like in Civilization 6 so you can give the map a once over and decide what things you want where, place all the markers for things on the ground, and go back to it later once you can actually build it, would be pretty cool.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.8322439789772034}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.6674319505691528}]"

137756528,"Its definitely a fun game very much a tower defense city management feel. the only thing i dont like is the lack of proactive/offensive options. that being said, its tower defense so ur not supposed to be able to curtail the offensive...but imho this game feels like it should have it. or at least offer a game mode with such. would really like to be able to take the fight to my opponent instead of holding out as long as possible. regardless this game is fun, the UI is good and the gfx are legit. something very rewarding about lazing a horde just as they are about to overwhelm ur troops/walls. devs if ur reading this id love to see a game mode where the assaults dont start until u ""clear"" the map of the local hostiles. would be cool to be able to build up first before the wave assaults begin. i know theres modes where the assaults are slower/take more days to initiate, but as a noob (and a perfectionist) its still too fast for my taste. coupling that with the need to expand as u progress makes it hard to lay out effective walls beforehand. just my 2 cents. OH! an alternate method for earning crystals (or whatever the unit is that allows the godlike abilities) would be very welcome. i appreciate the challenge of the limited amount, but would be cool to not contend with that too. maybe require worship or something time based which requires workers but is otherwise renewable/sustainable. anyway, this is a fun tower defense city manager RTS. i give it a good ol recommend, i can see this being a main-stay for me, especially if the devs keep adding to it.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.6015748977661133}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9849144816398621}]"

137373972,"So... Given that I have played this game for >800 hours to date (omg, how do I do facepalm emoji?), my review will hopefully be of some use to someone! Firstly, I love this game! The design, the humour, game play, most aspects in fact make this one of the most fun RTS I have possibly ever played...it's brilliant.. BUT... The one (and I truly think this is the only one) FATAL downfall that drives me insane about this game is the difficulty system.. It seems to me (a casual gamer of limited talent I am sure), that the easy mode is just too easy, but anything beyond that is just too difficult, and then the challenging modes are utterly pointless/total waste of time. It is immeasurably frustrating to constantly lose at the same time within every game regardless of the strategy you try to employ, the resources & time available to recoup from successive waves of attack are diminished so much that it is impossible to succeed beyond a set time frame, it is a zero sum situation that leaves you utterly downtrodden. I don't need a game to give me impossible odds, that is what life is for! I want something that gives me a consistent fighting chance so I can escape into an entertaining world where I get to overcome the odds! Isn't that why we have entertainment? Please fix the difficulty system, or provide options to adjust the odds, and this is an absolute gem for the ages...right now it has become utterly disheartening... UPDATE: Difficulty system is still a joke.... :(","[{'label': '2 stars', 'score': 0.5526884198188782}]","[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.8442376852035522}]"
137335453,"I like these games-Age of Darkness/TABs. Usually i like the realistic gritty ones. But I really like the brighter graphics on this one. I also think the game play is better, with more varied/fun units. But here is what i REALLY like about this one over those: In those games, it's really hard to expand, and space itself is a valuable resource. It's a good mechanic, really. But it means you essentially have to just blob down structures and cannot build fortifications in a magnificent fashion. Not so here. Here, you can build a huge, open fantastic fortification-or system of fortifications. You still better be careful expanding. And maybe some won't like that you don't have the added challenge of tight quarters. But I really like it. Anyway, this is just a fun, easy to get into RTS/defender with fun graphics, reasonable system requirements(now) and a lot of freedom. In short, it's a good game.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.7754693627357483}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9539019465446472}]"

I imagine a lot more is coming and that should make it repeatable and introduce different strategies. Overall, cool. I guess I thought it would be further along after a year+ in early access.

135089387,"Diplomacy is Not an Option provides a solid gaming experience, where the bright green grass not only adds a pop of color but also ensures excellent visibility of your relentless enemies. Their brutal attempts at diplomacy sadly fall short, much to their demise. In this unforgiving world, there are no negotiations with the leader of the attackers, no prisoners taken, and no mercy shown. And why is that, you might ask? It all started when they hurt my dog at the beginning of the game, awakening a ruthless avenger within me (not unlike the infamous John Wick). As you embark on your vengeance-fueled journey, you'll find yourself embracing the same unwavering determination and lack of compassion that John Wick is known for. After all, when diplomacy fails, there's only one thing left to do – show them why it's not an option. In conclusion, Diplomacy is Not an Option offers a thrilling adventure where mercy and negotiations have no place. With its eye-catching scenery and a storyline that sparks a fire within, you'll quickly discover that in this world, it's either fight or be defeated.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.6385900974273682}]","[{'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.4859938621520996}]"

131372607,"This game reminds me of STRONGHOLD... and older game that had better graphics. This is a simplified version of the medieval warfare game of castles and catapults. I like this one because of the ""chill"" factor. The designers didn't take themselves too seriously. They made a game where you could get a basic economy and have basic troops with some degree of difference in performance. By taking the path of least resistance, they gave us a game that has fun and strategy but goes easy on the learning curve and brain burn. There may still be bits of that if you ramp up the level of difficulty but it is entirely possible to learn the game quickly and have fun at the lesser levels. Graphics are not a strong point but they aren't poor either. You can clearly make out the buildings as well as the flora and fauna. It does not strive for strict realism but there are doses of that. Dead bodies left littering your home area cause people to get unhappy and even ill. Economics rears its ugly head to bring life in the game closer to reality but once you learn what to build and when, the game can be forgiving of little mistakes. Politics are ignored and I for one am pleased they are. Health issues are left at a basic level but not too basic. You must consider you populace while you are waging war. This can be a fun ""tower defense"" game or ramped up to be a serfdom mini-simulator. Some thought and good choices were put into the design which made it easier to enjoy this game. If you are looking for an uber-serious simulation, keep on moving. If you are looking for an inexpensive game that will make you think a bit about strategy while eating away time without too much stress? This is well worth you time and effort.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.7241455316543579}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.680320143699646}]"

129158933,"Ever wanted a cool tower defense game but takes 0 actual skill and setup and you have to use guides and know your ""build order"" just to survive the ""medium"" difficulty? Ever wanted RNG in your game to make sure you have to constantly reroll maps just to have a single hope of survival? Yeah, that's this game in a nutshell. The balancing for endless more is completely off, going from the easiest mode you can take a nap and still survive, while the medium difficulty makes sure to end your entire career because you got a garbage map set up that keeps you below the difficulty curve. The difficulty scaling of waves needs to be completely overhauled as you don't even get a chance by the 4 wave. Resources a joke, everything requires wood, yet wood cannot be replanted, leading to you being forced to expand to keep up with demand, which then leads to more food demand, which leads to more food sources, which leads to more wood. In order to keep up with his crazy cycle of wood demand you have to expand and make you base bigger, but as you make it bigger you need to make more and more walls just to secure weakness, yet there are hardly any choke points in a tower defense game, so expect to expand in a 360 map just to get stone, iron, and wood which are FINITE early game. Honestly the worst economic tower defense game I've played which punishes you for expanding, yet you NEED to if you get bad mountains, stone, or metal. This game forces perfection on any difficulty just to keep pace with the waves of enemies. By far it is the least relaxing tower defense game on the market, go play any other, at least you'll enjoy your time instead of hitting the reset button after an hour of failure again and again. Edit 8/13/24: Played the game again after years. I don't think a single thing has changed. Trash difficulty curve, RNG, limited resources, literally nothing has changed. I don't even see new units, maps, or anything except the sandbox mode. The sandbox mode kind of sucks to, making your options so limited. I'd like to actually see the devs play their own game without cheating in crap or you know, surviving past wave 4.","[{'label': '1 star', 'score': 0.5910223126411438}]","[{'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.4508408308029175}]"

127943577,"Love this game, but it needs to be balanced out!!! If they can tweak it to help balance it, it would be even better! It is really hard/possible to recover after a massive first wave in just 4 days, and then the second massive wave comes and you completely get wiped out! I barely have any time to build up an army let alone build up resources and buildings. On top of that there are also massive hordes of enemies way more powerful then you all over the map, blocking you from getting the resources you need to grow! So while your building your army up for an attack you also have to use that small army to attack enemies in your way further weakening yourself so you can get crushed by the next wave!!!! I like playing it but so far it feels massively unbalanced against you and I wish I could get to a lvl 3 town hall lol. So far I have not made it. I understand it shouldn't be super easy but right now it feels impossible to win on some missions. If there was a way to get resources faster or get your population to grow almost instantly when you build more buildings, rather then waiting days for results? Or lowering the amount of enemies around on the maps so your units don't get so destroyed? Or after you defeat a wave of enemies you get a bonus amount of resources after to help you recover slightly? I don't know, I think they have a great game and its a lot of fun to play, I am just feeling like I am missing something in order for me to experience more of the features the game has to offer. I have barely been able to make it to Town Hall II and have spent all my resources doing so. It doesn't even seem like there are enough resources on the map to get you past Town Hall II some times. I hope this gets seen and can be further balanced and or tweaked. They look like they spent a lot of time on the buildings, units, terrain, building materials, and enemy units! Really like this game and think it can go even further where the player isn't so beet up from having to multitask so much they miss out on things and can make it to the final wave more prepared. That or maybe its just me, and I am missing something, and I need to work on understanding the game more?","[{'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.42157506942749023}]","[{'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.3070526719093323}]"

125439435,"Diplomacy is Not an Option plays out like a pretty conventional RTS. You gather resources, kick start your production, and hire builders and soldiers to do gruntwork. The gimmick is that your enemy doesn’t have a base of operation. Instead, they attack you in waves from outside the map boundaries, at set intervals. Sort of like in a tower defense game. You know where they come from too, giving you some space to focus your defenses. And as a last push in their final attack, they also gather up stray units from encampments around the map -- giving you some mitigating busywork to do between the earlier waves. It’s fine. But I think I might have raised my hopes up a little too high. The marketing material makes it seem like this epic tower defense game, where you defend your bastion from closing armies. A real focus on scale and excess. Huge crescendos. Massive armies. Yet, the game starts out with such humble beginnings. Small armies defending tiny castles, with barely enough resources and units to go around. It’s both slow and punishing, never really reaching those epic proportions. It sort of just fizzles, somewhat unceremoniously. I’m sure it will reach those heights eventually. I’m just not interested in playing for tens of hours just to [i]eventually[/i] reach that point, when it feels like it should have been the core experience from the get-go. It’s a matter of expectations I guess. But it’s a pass for me either way.

The more I learn about the game the more I want to play. It can be easy to overlook the complexity and depth of city and defense layout, but it all starts by realizing how building storage next to production increases the rate of materials harvested, and how water fountains increase the population of nearby houses, or how builder houses need to be dispersed throughout the city in order to reduce the time it takes a builder to get to a construction site, and so on. There are quite a few different enemy types like undead, peasants, royal army, but there are not a large variety of units in each type, hopefully more will be added in the future. Campaign cut scenes are very amusing and I found myself looking forward to each one, which made learning the campaign isn't complete all that much more disappointing. As it currently is DNO is a great little game, and with more features to be added it should be worth looking forward to what comes next!","[{'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.4049212336540222}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.8736882209777832}]"

The only issue you may have with it is the performance on the later waves - many mobs, many buildings and many troops equals higher performance hit. But, if you are really playing on high difficulty, you won't notice probably, because you will find yourself pause-playing and micro-managing your defenses anyway.

120177375,FANTASTIC really a great strategy game its not finished yet however once it is there will be days of content to play though. I did the two campaign missions and did three challenge mode quest of course on ultra hardcore mode. both where super fun. I look forward to the remainder of the campaign. there is a huge map for the campaign so i hope it gets filled out with great missions. I really like the story of the lord following the ungrateful kings orders its really comical and worth playing through. The game is currently early access so grab it on sale when you can to help fund the development of the game. Id recommend it even in its current state. its really fun. I would love to see some more features however like maybe a chicken coop or something. The amount of warriors you can build works for the style of the game.

120073070,"This game is like a mix of city building, RTS, and tower defense games, and the exciting part is that you don’t have to like all of them to enjoy the game. For example, if you only want to build your dream city in peace, you can turn off the enemy altogether. However this game is very much a work in progress, it needs more content on all three aspects of the game. The city building part is especially lacking in depth: there needs to be more building types and complex mechanics for it to be interesting. As of right now, RTS and tower defense seem to be their main focus, city building feels more like a supplement to them. I enjoyed taking a small army to explore the surroundings and uncover the fog of war, and occasionally using my cavalry to crush the enemies, but there isn’t much else you can do with your units. Things like different formations, active skills, and flanking bonus from the Total War series will be good additions to the game. I also would like to see more defense towers added to the game. Currently, you just put your archers and siege weapons on the wall and that’s it. On a side note, this game desperately needs more Steam Cloud storage space. 100MB is simply not enough, considering that a single save file is 6 to 8MB. Overall, the game shows great potential and gets updated regularly. There are so many things they can add to this solid foundation.

In fact this game plays so much like TaB it's almost a skip from me, but time will tell what they add by release. For whatever reason I expected more accurate destructable environments - but walls just break once the HP is depleted the same way they do in any other game. There are no seige mechanics (e.g. Total War), the AI just attacks 10m of your 100m defences and everything is point and click.

118371633,"So this game is good. Like really good. Only took me about an hour and a half to see that it has potential. It also took me about an hour and a half to remember what it's like to be kicked in the taint with steel toe boots. This game is hard. It straight up tells you, so there's no surprise. So I go in and play the first campaign mission. Nothing crazy but it puts you through your paces. Then I meandered on over to endless mode. I just wanted a chill laid back experience so I selected the second to last easiest difficulty. The easiest makes it so no enemies spawn which I figured wouldn't be as fun. The first wave appears as I'm still building. Cool no biggie I have units. I wipe them out and continue upgrading and building my forces. My kingdom is lookin great and I like how this games flow is set up. Then the second wave appeared... A dark cloud of enemy units DOZENS of times larger than anything I've seen so far come raging from off map like a mass of starving locusts. In literal seconds my entire kingdom is no more. Balance and pacing are the two main issues I don't suggest this game. If I wanted to struggle min-max everything and be sweating beads, I'd just enter a Starcraft competition.

118210051,"for a game trying to rip off ""They are Billions"" it does so pretty well minus a couple of aspects, which unfortunately are deal-breakers. 1. You share defensive and building resources, want a group of archers? that's fewer workers to make food to keep the archers alive (yes units starve to death, then turn into zombies and attack from wherever they died) 2. A.I pathways, they suck, you put down a tree hut, lower the zone so they don't wander too far to cut trees, so they go ahead and walk right through a raider camp, that's outside the designated zone you made for them, and guide those lovely raiders right back into your city before you're ready. 3. difficulty scale, this one is hard to be constructive about. wave one you fight maybe 20 people, wave 2 you're at about 200, wave 3 you're at about 500-600 hundred raiders including siege engines, and larger stronger enemies, wave 4? who knows, I've never been able to get that far. I even went as far as to create 6 layers of walls with about 30 archers per wall, and as many sword-men, I could fit in that time frame, they got devoured. 4. performance. it's a crap shoot. 5. variety, not a ton other than the glaring issues the game is very fun, if you like playing for 30 minutes, restarting, and playing again, kinda like an old school demo! good luck","[{'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.43986794352531433}]","[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.5227972269058228}]"

117916196,"Fun, but has fairly noticeable technical and game balance shortcomings. Technical: - Saves of more than a few hours of gameplay in Endless mode will not load within reasonable timeframe (30 min or less). This is the dealbreaker for me. - Game running for a while at higher wave sizes still suffers from significant performance drops - can be somewhat helped by restarting game, but then runs into the problem above. This is with a fairly powerful rig. Game Balance: - Diversity of units is very limited. While it appears as though there are many units (~8 infantry, 3 siege), half of them are completely replaced by later units (ie. Archer by Crossbowman, Swordsman by Spear/Hammerguy) and lose all relevance once you unlock the later units (fairly quickly). - Ballista is overshadowed by both Catapult and Trebuchet in all noticeable applications. It lacks a useful niche (like good DPS or range to counter enemy catapults) to make up for having no AoE, something that the other 2 have in droves. - Upgrade system is too barebones - upgrades generally apply to only one unit, with no further progression or synergy. Would recommend a ""wait and see"" approach for now - it's still a fun game with potential, but still needs a good deal of polish and rework to really shine.","[{'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.7009185552597046}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.7279952168464661}]"

117688365,"This game is like an awesome blast from the past - a faithful and interesting love letter to the old Stronghold games, but with more modern graphics and control system. I did feel that this game is missing a bit of the character of the old Stronghold games - the campaign text is funny but it might at times be a little *too* silly. It can be fun to have heroic, brave, or more interesting characters thrown in the mix as well. Also, without voice acting for the campaign, it essentially boils down to watching a long cutscene of just text bubbles, which definitely made me miss how that was handled in Stronghold. This game is still early access, obviously. The campaign isn't done yet, but the 3 missions I played were a blast. I hope they incorporate more story persistent elements (for instance, I let my peasant revolt hero die accidentally and didn't see any acknowledgement of that in the cutscene dialogue, although I can chalk that up to the game being in early access. All in all, if you want a fun, fresh Stronghold-inspired game, this is a great choice!

117654296,"TLDR: The game is very fun and addictive but suffers from a lack of resources and ways of obtaining more and quality of life features. I managed to reach day 70 in endless mode on max difficulty, only to be beaten by not having anything to plug holes or even fix walls/towers/troops. I simply got overrun as there was no way for me to acquire more stone or iron. A trading cap of selling max 300 wood every 2 minutes is way to slow in the latter rounds. By the time a new wave arrives you may have traded 900 wood for 150 iron or 300 stone, which is fuck all in this game and barely a small wall or a few towers. Another problem is that this game works with a coin system only obtainable trough that already limited market, so you'll have to spend time on that as well, which further limits your options for stone and iron. They either need to add a more complex market system, allow (way) higher amounts to be traded at once or add a way to have unlimited stone and iron. There's also the problem that if you want to focus on enemy artillery you'll need to do it manually, as there's only an ""attack nearby"" and ""attack strongest"" option. Problem is that enemy catapults are not considered in both these options. It would be nice if there was a button to specifically focus on enemy artillery, with for example ballistas (who can use a range upgrade as right now they're very weak and useless). EDIT: according to the FAQ this is getting fixed next update. If you're looking to buy this game to see how long you'll survive don't bother (yet). It has a lot of potential and is very fun, but until then i can't really recommend it, unless you maybe do the missions, which i personally don't care about. I heard they're reworking late game economics so I'd wait until then, right now it's a no, but like i said, has a shit ton of potential.","[{'label': '2 stars', 'score': 0.44389909505844116}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8458832502365112}]"
117645882,"A smoll, great RTS game really, been ages since i found one this fun and challenging. BUT I'm gonna start with a big con here, the game might be TOO challenging. It is very fast paced. You NEED to multitask, kinda all the time. You need to manage your resources, food, population while building up an army so you can defend yourself against waves and other outposts on the map. The fast paced is because you only get 3-4 in-game days before the next wave comes, which is bigger and always stronger. And at the end every single outpost you did not clear, will attack you + 5 big waves at once. Yes. You're done, it's almost impossible. It's all about management and choices really. But this aside, the game is great. The building options, upgrading, resources, population, placing your army or katapults on the walls for bigger range etc it's really well done. It's so satisfying to build an really big army and position them next and behind eachother. It's well made, for an early access game, no bugs so far, no crashing. Running the game is smooth And yeah, there's also so much potential that can make this game 10 times better.

115911572,"i love this game, very enjoyable and has good potential. My main issue as of now is that even on Endless mode it feels as if you don't get enough time in between waves. The struggle between upkeep and having to worry about massive waves every 5 days to 6 days is a tad harsh. Making it every 10 days or every 15 would be great, allowing more time for defense to be built and to have town management to happen. Cant wait to see updates, and hopefully see more house types, troop types, and maybe traps to be made to help repel attacks. Even the option to build wall catapult for heavy damage on the attackers. Update: After some more time on the game I'm pretty sure the main problem is upgrading to tier 3 being very costly and the waves being way to large at a very early start. Wave 3 jumps the gun by so much and i think the waves should be every 10-15 days and not every 6. Very great game, just needs a wave nerf.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.6725703477859497}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.8077956438064575}]"

Units' status can be slightly higher with the exp they gain from battle. 5. More souce of food (Fish should be renewable resources, and hunting ect. 6. Auto trading (making exchange of food for stone and iron in later game easier. 7. More hero units, can buff surrounding normal units. 8. Units in story mode should be different when siding with the king or the rebels. 9. Siege warfare as the attackers? (More Siege unit like scaling ladder, battering ram ect.) 10. More defence unit like moat, barbed wire and so on. 11. Magician with attack magic, Necromancer who can summon zombie warrior, and Musketeers maybe? 12.

For instance, setting up a simple two-step move (aka waypoint) requires to press and hold the shift key before even the first move order. Another example, once your units are on top of walls, they will refuse to go down them if there is even ONE non-walled unit in your selection group. This forces you to either select the wall segments one-by-one, or double clic to select them all and risk giving orders to more than the intended group.

This combines the gameplay mechanics of other base survival games but with an art style that is very nice to look at. The comedic elements present in the game, chiefly the ""story"" cut scenes are much appreciated and work at making sure its not just a soulless tower defense game. I'm very intrigued with the prospect of a branching story mode that may change based on your decisions- such as choosing to support your lord or the rebelling faction. I find myself checking every other day for updates just so I can jump back in and play another 10+ hours.

112434086,"Save your money. This game keeps crashing at later stages of the game. Not to mention fps drops to 15fps on later enemy waves (not a potato pc) I managed to get to day 58 on hardest difficulty on endless. 80k kills. Had a crash almost every day since day 38, and the only reason I lost on 58 is because I got bored of micromanaging my towers to target hundreds of enemy siege 1 by 1. Can't even shift click on enemy... Never managed to get so many enemies on the map as it's being advertised on the screenshots. Zombies seem to be allied with the raiders... Prepare to micro-micromanage your every tower to target enemy siege weapons. Why isn't is a setting? You have one for targeting nearest and strongest enemy. Prepare to trade 150-300 resources for 7-30 gold every 2 minutes. Prepare to get frustrated with your citizens getting stuck on each other or corners of buildings. If you liked They Are Billions and like medieval setting you will like this, that is until you run into all those issues I mentioned above. There were a few other issues I had but can't remember them now. Skip this for now until it gets more polish and fixes or buy when on sale for 50%. 4/10 right now but has the potential to be an 8/10.

112413228,"Awesome game. Perfect mix of thought and somewhat mindless play. Watching hordes of foes get mowed down by concentrated crossfire is great. Later waves do lock up the game currently, once you break day 120 to 150 I have noticed more frequent crashing but that is to be expected in early access games. I do hope to see more features in later updates. What would make this even better? Easier deployment of troops to walls currently players have to individually place archers on the walls, a group deployment would be great. As far as new features, LADDERS SIEGE TOWERS, RAMS, BOILING OIL, MURDER HOLES would take this to the next level. Lets get to a place where we place melee troops on the walls to repel invaders hand to hand...lets add MOATS, TRAPS. Combat on the walls, maybe give attackers the option to MINE beneath the walls... IDK if the designer looks at these comments, I hope so because this is a blast overall. New way to play.... let players take the role of attacker and assault AI designed fortresses... the goal? Take the fort in as few waves as possible... Just some ideas that I think would really expand replay value and could make a really awesome multi player option.... anyway, great game overall, I cant wait to see what future updates bring.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.6092329025268555}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.7484493851661682}]"

Maybe my review won't get read or noticed but I have to clear the air with some criticism and suggestions in hopes of improving the game.

Suggestions for improvements: - Options to improve resource depletion efficiency during late game ( as there is forester for wood, and farms for food), or regeneration of stone and iron deposits. - An option to select and move multiple units which are in towers, and an ability to move units from tower to tower directly. - An option to upgrade weaker units into stronger ones directly, instead of dismissing and recruiting new ones, and maybe later branching of unit upgrades into different specialisations. - An option to deactivate the ''hold attack'' stance on units without needing to move them. - The presence of a game encyclopedia with information about foe types, weaknesses, strengths. - Other means of obtaining gold, such as maybe sparse gold mines to be extracted by respective gold collection building type. - Perhaps, an ability to promote units after a certain number of kills by the unit, which may come with stat and/or cosmetic enhancements. - Co-op mode ? Build together with a friend and protect against the waves, exchange materials, plan out base building, sounds fun to me at least. - I have heard this one on multiple other reviews so I guess I'll support it here as well... more magic related units, you know the usual fire for burning, ice for slowing...blah blah...","[{'label': '2 stars', 'score': 0.5979124903678894}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.6484858393669128}]"

112006954,"The game is good, however there are a few problems that I hope will be fixed in time. The way in which you can define the action zones of certain buildings (e.g. gatherers or lumberjacks) needs to be improved. For example, instead of choosing the centre of the zone and then frantically clicking on the button to enlarge/shrink the zone, it would be more practical to simply right-click and drag. In the same way the AI of the builders should be improved or allow to have an efficient way to micromanage them, for example allow buildings to have the same building priority and let the AI choose which builder goes on which building in order to minimize unnecessary moves. We should be able to put the market in automatic mode, we define which resource we want to sell and against what, and each time the airship comes back it leaves as soon. Or else to have a queue of trades to do that are done automatically each time the airship comes back. The AI of catapults and trebuchets should also be improved, when it is set to ""attack the nearest enemy"" it should nevertheless make it possible to type in a way to take maximum advantage of zone damage. Similarly when it comes to targeting the strongest enemies, the name is ambiguous and it should be possible to choose exactly what type of enemy to target first. Also it should be possible to remove several buildings at once, possibly with a confirmation popup. We should also be able to garrison a whole wall with archers at once instead of having to garrison them one by one, it's so annoying that I've given up on the idea of placing archers on it.","[{'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.6255233883857727}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.960909903049469}]"

111887590,This game is very addicting and fun to play. It keeps you on your toes at all times. Very fast paced with no room for mistakes. It keeps you thinking all of the time. There are a few things that I wish were better like more buildings and a way to farm/produce soul crystals as well as an improvement to the market system. At some point you exhaust all of the maps resources and the market just is not fast enough to keep up with your resource demand. Either expand the ability and capacity of the market place or allow multiple market places to be built. An auto trade feature would also be great. Apart from that I absolutely love this game.

Multiplayer either via coop or pvp would be amazing, and I wish that I had some means of expansion for when the random seed sets all of the stone/iron far away, but plenty of time for QOL additions. As a few others have mentioned though, very little campaign content which is a bummer. There were 2(.5) missions available, and I'm not sure what kept them from adding more, as even those missions seemed to be procedurally generated. I also found myself a little irritated with having to quash the locals before the final wave instead of being able to build up an impressive grand army/defensive perimeter. It's most certainly doable, but the gap in difficulty was ridiculous, it felt that you very much HAD to clear the map or risk being overwhelmed. Overall a fun game, don't know if I feel it's worth the 25$ price tag right now, but if they add the content that it looks like they've prepared for, and implement some multiplayer functions this will be an awesome game to play with some friends or solo for fans of RTS!","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.7398039102554321}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.8445863127708435}]"

You can make it easier by choosing the easiest difficulty, but where's the fun in that? Also, your choices in the game affect how difficult it is. Want to side with the people and fight the monach? Yeah, it's going to be harder than siding with the king and fight peasants. - Not a ton of content at the moment, but it is in early access, so that's to be expected.

111524605,"Fantastic game! Well built and plays very well! If you are a fan of games like StarCraft or base defense games in general, you should really enjoy this one! Many of the mechanics we already know are well executed and the controls are very similar, so learning is very easy. There's not much to complain about, but I do want to point out some balance issues that I found to reduce the flow of the game for me. In the beginning of the rounds, base building has a great balance between resource gathering and construction. It's very easy to develop a flow and balance everything you need to advance. However, there's a point where you have to build a ""Market"" that is designed to somehow generate a new resource (by that point), a gold coin. This coin is a requirement to upgrade buildings and certain units. I unfortunately couldn't get this to work, even when trading for resources that I didn't need. The ability to trade for resources only becomes valuable when you get a map that doesn't spawn a specific resource within your starting area... I assume. This rarely happens however, so this building becomes extremely pointless for me and forced my strategy to successfully function without it. Maybe it's a glitch or something I was doing wrong, but after ten trades in one round, I was unable to generate one single coin. So I found that you can just create an old ""Zerg"" defense setup to overcome the lack of upgrades allowed by this building. I have beat the couple rounds that the game currently has, but I am a little frustrated that I haven't been able to see or try ANY of the buildings or units that require these coins. With all that being said, I still think it's a great game! With it still being in development, I'm sure we'll see some adjustments/fixes that will make things like this much better. This game has some great potential and is a great addition to the genre! With the fun humor, well balanced difficulty, and attention to quality, this game goes high on my recommendation list. Can't wait to see what else this title has to bring!","[{'label': '5 stars', 'score': 0.6086052060127258}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.7358439564704895}]"

Peasant's wave maybe sporadic, unorganized and huge numbered. But the king's army is well-trained. They have formations, discipline, tactics. The endless mode, however, is just CPU burning. Watching trebuchet and the nuclear weapon shelling the peasants into the sky is a relief of stress. But when your FPS decreaseed you feel stress again. Even computer with GPU 3060 and CPU i7-11800H crashed at the 40th days horde. It is understandable that millions of enemies are generated together and each of them has a independent AI control. Just like 7dtd A20's horde, my suggestion is strengthen the peasants but reduce the number. Other way, maybe ask NASA if they have a spare computer. Also, if this game just keeps defending yourself and always starts with one TC and several villagers, it will become boring soon. Perhaps learning from campaign mode in Age Of Empires. Such as, you completed a side mission, you get rewarded and the next wave will become easier. Or just start with a huge amount of armies who are far from home and don't have enough supplies. No TC, no villagers, and supposed to capture the city in 7 days. Or your ally is in danger, when we arrived we found it is a trap and so on. Anyway, looking forward to the co-operate mode and the full-launch version. Maybe PvP mode is also considerable.","[{'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.4969637393951416}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.7404302358627319}]"

I really really enjoy the game and I'm not frustrated because it's very early access, but I'll wait a few months before picking it up again. (Edit: This issue has also been fixed.) Also, when I select one unit by clicking on it once, the game often decides to highlight every unit of it's type on my screen instead (as if I double-clicked.) This happens extremely frequently, to the point where most of my micromanagement time in battle was spent double-checking that I didn't accidentally select all of my archers when I'm only trying to send an individual to get on the wall. My mouse does not give my double click issues in other games. Aside from that, I enjoy everything about No Diplomacy as an EA title and agree with all the other positive reviews.

With research, perhaps the final tech could serve as a Civ ""future tech"" and allow you to improve efficiency when playing an endless mode.

110651556,"I'd like to categorize my review as ""Recommended with a couple of small caveats."" First, the good parts: The biggest plus of this game is that it is addictingly fun. I usually wait a while after wishlisting a game, but I had such a blast with the demo that I decided to buy this at full price, and definitely feel I've gotten my money's worth in enjoyment. This game is challenging, but in my opinion does a good job of making it ""challenging but fun"" as opposed to ""infuriatingly difficult"" - when I get overrun, I don't want to ragequit, but try again and see if I can do better. It also has a nice art style, and while the tutorial doesn't show everything you can do, I've found that it's not difficult to intuit how to play this game in terms of tactics, upgrades, etc. Now for the caveats: This is an early access game, and so the campaign mode currently only has two missions - the map indicates that there's a lot more planned, but a lookup in discussions indicates that the campaign mode will be fleshed out over the coming year. There is an endless mode to help keep you satiated before more missions are added, but do keep that in mind. Also, mileage may vary in terms of price - I feel I got my money's worth, but I can understand others being hesitant with the asking price. Also, there's still a couple of bugs. In my case, the game has been running pretty well, even though my PC is several years old and nowhere near the latest specs, but the campaign cutscenes are lacking visuals for me - just the audio and a black screen.","[{'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.5071330070495605}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.8899056315422058}]"

Different terrains influencing the enemy for example , or special enemy units which focus on weakpoints and call the others to that point so you wanne have him dead like the torch guy in helms deep. Endgame economy is: Set up your woodfactory and farms(storage, foresters and lumberjacks) and be sure not to forget to trade other stuff for wood every 30 seconds.

110543474,"This game is essentially a clone of Stronghold with some features added. Between enemy waves you get to go and farm mobs with your army. In return you get some resources and mana points. The game has magic - you can summon troops or attack spells. You need to micro in early game because there are a lot of enemies and not many of your troops. Graphics are pretty nice if you are into this simplistic style. The hotkey scheme is pretty cool. Things to improve: The interface is a bit clunky - you have to remember where things are and it's not obvious. No control groups - why?? You can't control group units or buildings. Maybe I didn't figure it out, but if you need to figure out ctrl groups then something is wrong. Enemy AI is weird - they just go to the first unit that they agro on and then just keep chasing it. Good for kiting, Waves aren't done well. You don't know in advance where the waves will be coming from and you only get warning 2 minutes in advance. So you can't build proper defences in your first run of the mission. If that is done to inflate game time or just poor design I don't know, but it needs to be fixed. In Stronghold you see atack locations from the start of the mission - that is how it should be. Resource income is not shown in any obvious location - do I need more food gatherers? Do I need more wood cutters? Who knows. Waypoint placements don't work properly. It needs to work like in StarCraft 2. Loading and unloading of troops into towers doesn't work properly.

Being forced to use spells to barely survive just doesn't add to the fun. Can we get a casual gamemode please?

I think the challenge comes from managing such large scale battles and kingdoms as things will occur that will hinder progress and will take attention away from battles. There is also the time management challenge of waves coming every few days and at first it is manageable but as the game goes on the army sizes increase exponentially. The art style is neat and helps keep the game light. During the campaign, you also get simple cinematics that are funny and make it worth beating the next level to see the next one. Great game and neat innovations on the RTS genre.

The campaign is about 1 hour long and the endless mode always crashes. I've essentially reached the end of the endless-mode on day ~150, even on a very capable PC there are just too many enemies for the game to handle. I really hope the dev implements more features such as bug-reports to help iron out the crashing, then it would already be a great game.

110393241,"Great game, very well made and fun city builder and strategy game. I really like the art style, and there is a lot to this game. The only complaint I have is that in some areas the UI doesn't give you enough information. The info it tells you on the food producing buildings is confusing, and I don't see where it tells you total amount of food produced per day, just how much you are consuming per day. This makes it difficult to figure out how many food producing buildings you need to build, that's my only complaint. Edit: After about 8 additional hours of gameplay I want to come back and add to my review. My initial review was after only beating the first campaign mission. After playing some more, I managed to beat the second campaign mission on the medium difficulty, it was really hard and took many attempts. There are currently only 2 campaign missions and an endless mode, which I was disappointed to figure out. As others have stated, I feel like this game is a bit too difficult, and requires too much micromanagement. You have to stay as focused as possible the entire time you are playing to have even a chance at success, it is not a casual experience. I don't know if that's the Devs intent or not, but I'd prefer a more casual experience IMO. I wish their was a sandbox mode, I'd like to play around with more of the later game stuff without having to grind really hard to get to that point.

It's challenging but not impossible. But then you play the 2nd level, and the difficulty level spikes up way too drastically. It's not bad to fail a level a few times before you get it right, but because the level layouts are random it's RNG on whether you'll get a good start and also means it's very difficult to plan and learn from each failure. The levels also take just long enough to get to the final wave that when you fail it feels like a huge waste of time. There's also much needed QoL that needs to be added to the game, like a way to find idle units or being able to jump to units/buildings/civs under attack. I really hope this game makes it through EA and comes out a great game.

Nearby areas are infested with enemies that you need to fight and clear out. As you expand your footprint, you also need to expand your defenses to protect your resource production. I think the game is currently a little under-balanced in that there is too little wood in each tree. Should make them last longer.

If you manage to make it a far ahead, the game punishes you in the worst way... throw a million enemies at me and lose that way, i dont care but good god at least let me prepare for the next wave. This isnt cod zombies, we need time to prepare for the waves considering theres alot of enemies and alot to build and rebuild. The waves come so close together that by the time you beat the wave, the next one is coming in less than a few minutes.... no time to build back up and try to advance your base. It doesnt help that things cost too much so advancing fast is a no go....sometimes you are at the mercy of map design tho. If things cost less for building, then the fast waves wouldnt be a problem. I get its endless and eventually youll die but the way the game is implemented for waves and building cost is just not fun at all, youll have no chance and itll make the last few hours feel pointless. If the next wave counter started when the last wave was killed then it would be alot more fun with the resource costs we face.

110315563,"Having a lot of fun with this game. There are some issues but while the game is in Early Access, luckily most of the game so far feels polished. There's only two campaign missions right now but they are fun and the cut-scenes have some decent humor. After that you have to play endless mode which is where most of my time is right now. It's good for a good chunk of fun time but there are some issues that come up. Difficulty scaling is the biggest issue in my opinion. The lowest difficulty is okay but feels slightly too easy. So your first reaction is to go to the medium difficulty and maybe that'll be perfect right? Wrong. The medium difficulty is easily 3x+ as hard as the lower one and personally is quite unfun to me. And if you get a mediocre map on top of that just call it quits and restart. There needs to be a balance on the medium difficulty for endless or a 4th difficulty option set between the two. Late game when the screen starts to flood with enemies the game will lag and stutter especially if you zoom out, and if you use the fast forward mods you are likely to crash. Not a hardware issue just an optimization issue with that many enemies. However before you get to that absurd point the game does run amazing to me. There are some bugs such as the game not leaving the grid/build mode unless you open it again and place or left click on an object, but otherwise nothing that's more than even a slight inconvenience. At $25 the game in it's current state may be slightly over priced, but I have thoroughly enjoyed my time so far. If you're a major fan of this genre or catch it on sale I'd say grab it.

110311844,"Love it. Satisfyingly challenging with great progression as your settlement is improved. An overarching sense of claustrophobia from both the nearby enemy camps and the need to build compactly to make sure that you can consolidate your defence forces for the final attack. This is different to other settlement building games where extensively sprawling out is a requirement to becoming strong. That being said, you will need to dip your toes into the wilderness as you deplete resources nearby. This makes it all the more tense and exciting. The developers may need to make tweaks to the difficulty settings if they want to facilitate players that want an easy ride, but I personally love the challenge. Some waves that show up make me think 'Are you serious!?' but I like being kept on my toes. The narrative at the start of each campaign mission is amusing and a bit weird, and could do with speeding up at times, but shows promise for some wild & silly stories as they add more missions.

The game however is far too hard, even on easy mode. There is little to no room for error and success is pretty much just based on the rng of map generation. Some maps suck and you get screwed. Some are amazing and the game is easy. If you want an easier game, you should probably wait a few months until full release when they add even easier game mode. While there are many problems, mostly with difficulty, for a game that only came out a few days ago as of now is amazing. I highly recommend the game to people willing to take a challenge. There are a few game breaking bugs when it comes to waves but the game auto saves enough that it's never a problem. Worth it for the price. Edit: Game has become far more playable and is actually just perfect. Nearly all bugs are gone and has much content. Now with endless supply, rng is no longer a problem.

110267998,"20+ hours in and I can safely say I'm really enjoying it, and already got my monies worth. Very similar to They Are Billions, however I would actually say I enjoy this game more. With TAB I would get so demoralized after a loss, it felt like time wasted and I'd want to play something else. With this I simply want to jump right back in to try to do better. I will say a lot of your success feels like RNG, since the maps are procedurally generated you'll feel like your getting steam rolled 2 or 3 times before you get your footing or get a good map with a lot choke points. It's also still in very Early Access, I was disappointed to see the big beautiful campaign map only to realize only 2 missions are currently available. However the endless mode has kept me plenty preoccupied, and I look forward to seeing where the game goes from here. EDIT: It has now been just over 2 years since I posted this review, and while I have enjoyed my time with the game and the dev's have worked hard to continue to improve and refine the horde modes and game play loop, I can't help but admit I become extremely dissapointed with the lack of any (playable) progress on the campaign. The dev's have been saying continually that they just need more time, and they don't want to release it until its ready, but then why did the game launch with the first 2 missions if the plan was to wait until the entire campaign was done to release anything else? I will still keep my review positive, but at this time I would say buy it if you're okay with different horde-mode repayable matches. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE PROMISE OF A CAMPAIGN. Buy it for what it is and you'll be happy, but I do not have faith in the devs to deliver any campaign for the foreseeable future.","[{'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.3425993323326111}]","[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.7793434858322144}]"

The game provokes you to spam soldiers asap leaving you with slow resource income for better and stronger buildings/defences in the long run unless you spam houses which will only cause food issues.

110189165,"OK, this recommendation is a yes but only in terms of, is it worth playing. Not value for money. It's absolutely not worth 25 bucks at the moment. Very early days but I like it. It's like Stronghold meets They Are Billions, which is interesting. The art style isn't bad, the gameplay is pretty straightforward (build an economy, build walls and troops, survive waves of enemies) but rewards good play and brutally punishes bad play. Right now there's two campaign levels, although I imagine we'll see more rapidly. The difficulty is tuned fairly high; when you make mistakes you'll suffer. At the same time, I was able to recover from fairly disastrous waves quickly without a cascade of failures which isn't the case in many similar games. Like I said, at the moment it is absolutely 100% not worth paying 25 dollars for, at all. Like I said, two campaign levels. That said I think there's real potential and I'll play it again in a few months, so I don't regret buying it.","[{'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.64894038438797}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.699951708316803}]"

110181402,"A decent horde defense game. Never played they are billions, but I have grown up playing a lot of RTS games. -The pacing of the game is very well done, with the player being incentivized to spend a fair amount of time on each town hall level to build up economy and defenses. Each level has meaningful jumps in power and production if you take the time to invest in them -The unit variety is decent for a game like this, and I can say every unit makes sense at some point in the game. -Economy looks simple on the surface, but actually has a bit of depth. Between the productivity boosting buildings you get late in the game, and location of storages to minimize travel time, to upgrading structures, there is a lot going on here. -Simplistic magic system. Four spells, you unlock more as you upgrade a certain structure. Each has a use, but I wish there was more to it. -Very clever upgrade mechanic, with useful upgrades that boost just about every aspect of you ability to build and defend. -Clever city management mechanics, albeit at a very surface level. I think this is the weaker part of the game, with the disease/grave mechanic being easily ignorable if you play well enough. -Humor in the campaign got me more than once. Very dry, I love it. -Enemy variety is fairly basic, but oh dear is there a lot of em. -Good pacing in terms of the map. You have to build an offensive part of your army, because so much is gated on going out and killing rebel camps/buildings. The campaign is very short, and a lot of mechanics still need a bit of work, but overall, I think this is very promising, and the devs are VERY receptive to feedback. There was a small difficulty balance patch on day one or two, so seems very good on that front. I think the devs have what it takes to make this a great game, and I am willing to invest a bit more based on how promising the demo and game are now. If you don't think so, wait for a sale. I, however, very much enjoy it now, and wholeheartedly recommend it.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.6945834755897522}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.6807595491409302}]"

110108417,"What the heck? My keep gets repeatedly attacked for absolutely no reason. The villagers in this game are completely unreasonable, I needed their food and resources to make my keep larger, taking it was justified. Seriously, this is really good. Mechanics are straight forward but well done. The bread and butter of the game are the huge, organic enemy armies. Blasting them is very satisfying. Edit (after playing part of the campaign): It's worth being aware of the difficulty. The campaign missions ramp up a lot. You may need to play some survival mode to build up your skills for some of those. And even survival mode, the max difficulty setting are very hard. Be prepared to pause a lot to fight multiple battles at a time, re-load to earlier points, and still lose even with those. That said, this type of game needs an ultra-high difficulty setting or some players will be bored.","[{'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.4334091544151306}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.59332674741745}]"

110100375,"I like this game, however there is room for improvements. * Campaign only has 2 maps - i was really disappointed. * Campaign maps are just normal maps, i expected to play hand crafted maps and take over command of a town or a city to defend. * Performance issues in late game endless mode, even with high end pc game starts to freeze and crash. Made it to day 100 in ""easy"" mode. * No way to generate crystals? Thats bad, i would like to see some mechanic, e.g. religion / worth shipping a statue to generate crystals * Enemies should set up camps before the attack and if you attack it and destroy parts of it or completly the enemy wave wont be that strong * When two or more buildings are selected a promt is needed when you want to delete them. Currently it is way to easy to delete all your buildings * Archers on walls are highly inefficient to place. A mass place mode for connected walls is needed. * Building ON rocks should be possible and also very expensive. * Rivers and bridges would be cool. * Forester should be available one castle level earlier. * Cavalery should be able to run down enemies in the inital charge. Maybe upgrade to use lance and not sword. * I would like to play the other side and siege a city / castle. * More upgrades, more research and more defense mechanics would also be great. * I am missing tactics and strategies. The game is a bit shallow. Wall up, build towers, build mechanics workshop and shoot everything with catapult and such. Edit1: * A wizzard and/or a saucerer would be great. Wizzards attack from back line with spells. Saucerer uses buffs and debuffs. Edit2: I forgot to write something what i like about this game: * Food and wood generation are self suffient in mid and late game which is great. You still have to expend the base for stone and iron. * No more ""carriers"" from the demo.

110076546,"Worst EA I´ve played so far. Played the tutorial which is quite OK. Started playing the campaign. First mission on medium difficulty is just a walk in the park. Playing mission two for four hours now. Even on easiest difficulty its unbeatable. Thanks to mission two I cannot refund anymore due to exceeting the two hours limit of Steam. Additionally game is extremly dull and boring. Everything takes extremly long while there´s always a time limit working against the player. Controls are completly inaccurate so you have to check back constantly. Players unit AI is a catastrophe. Some units start to attack while the rest is just standing there watching. This way enemy units can just chop down your own units bit by bit. This all leads to a frustrating high level of micromanagement of about a dozen units and buildings in total. On the other hand the gameplay lacks any kind of variation. You´re doing exactly the same thing a dozen times a minute. And last but not least the devs want some exorbitant 20€ for this dumpster fire of a game that never saw any kind of quality management. No idea how to justify that amount of money for such a dull and annoying game. So if you like inaccurate controls, frustrating micromanagement and a minimal amount of variation in gameplay this game might be the right thing for you. For everyone else: make a giant leap around it since you´re not missing out anything important.","[{'label': '1 star', 'score': 0.5939676761627197}]","[{'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.5625205636024475}]"

I find myself wanting more and more. I didn't have any game lag or slow down. I really love every aspect of what this games brings. If I had any complaints I would say that this game can actually be really hard. The middle tier difficulty ""Challenge Accepted"" is quite tough at the end. You have to have to be max Town-hall level with tier 3 walls to stop the forces from bulldozing the city. Then with a crazy amount of archers or siege equipment then you should be able to stop the forces coming from all sides...Yes all sides.. Not to mention all the enemy troops that were left on the map that you didn't fight. As much as I felt frustrated in that aspect I learned to become more efficient and better. Which was a joy to play and learn from my mistakes. I think all I can ask is give me more citizens per house so I can have more soldiers.

Destroying that element fixes the problem, but if you don't spot it early your buildings won't finish on time -Upgrading town hall to lvl3 is bit too expensive.

A bit of comment/suggestion here: 1. the citizens can be a bit more personalised, instead of just assigning work forces, would be great to randomise names for them, and be able to check where they are. 2. As the path finding of the game is really interesting, sometimes a building shows the resident is stuck somewhere not able to reach the work place and i cant spot the resident. 3. with smaller units like individual soldiers or even catapults it's okay that they lump together when they get recruited, but because the hitbox of the trebuchets are so large when they are spawned and stuck together it happened to me that they kind of squeeze into each other and launched one of them away. So alternatively making the spawn spot not a single spot but a row or even an area would make the troops look much nicer. 4. enemy catapult count is off the roof in late game in endless. once you pass the tenth wave, you get a giant wave of catapult after the soldiers. maybe substitute 10 for a trebuchet or balista? the catapults don't really do much to walls but they are all piled together looking very weird","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.7985603213310242}]","[{'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.9775958061218262}]"

110033353,"Currently in early access and I'm by no means a hardcore player, but for $20, I would say wait to buy this until it gets more development. The Campaign is NOT worth bothering with at this time. I made it to the second what looked like at least a dozen towns. The final wave seems intended to kill you so that you don't know, in game, that there is only TWO campaign missions. The story scenes feel... dull, but at least it is a plot of sorts that might make for an interesting campaign later. The random maps make it impossible to plan strategies and resources when you lose and have to try again. Even though I was on the easiest difficulty the resource management made it feel like it was intended to starve my advancement arbitrarily rather than making for fun player choices. I like random maps if it feels like I have the flexibility to deal with an excess of one map feature and a near lack of the other. The problem is, the balance is so tightly defined that anything but a perfect map or expert execution will punish you without chance for recovery. That said, this game has a lot of *potential* to be fun. The systems and structure of the game work nicely, the ramping up is too high on the enemies and the resources for the players are too limited to allow a fun progression for the player, but at least the genre and the graphics are nice. Edit: I suppose I could say, recommend with caveats. The lack of campaign content still bugs me and, for me, the difficulty is still a bit too unpleasantly punishing, but for folks who like grueling survive the wave style of games, I guess it's a good pick seeing as the developers are doing great at listening to players and adding updates and the endless mode is quite playable even now.","[{'label': '2 stars', 'score': 0.442053884267807}]","[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.7642428278923035}]"

I would like it if there was an option to turn off the camps and outposts because I like the game a lot but having to deal with stupid ass outpost all the time constantly is annoying.

110020458,"Absolutely horrifically balanced. I'm not overly familiar with games like they are billions etc. so when i got my ass handed to me, I assumed it was due to missing experience with this type of game. Turned down the difficulty and got swamped even more. tried several times on several difficulties and no change. The maps are randomly generated, so naturally the difficulty is as well. Whether or not you get access to natural choking points, such as cliffs or water, is up to the cointoss. Even the Campaign maps are fully random. I'm not sure how the devs are guiding their difficulty curve if they can't be arsed to create even the Campaign maps. Enemies come from random directions and you get very little warning time as to where they'll spawn, so reactively building up a defense is out of the question. Building up an all-purpose omnidirectional defense is also out of the question because you can't have a defending army AND generate the required ressources in time. You can build up the defense if you dedicate the entire settlement to ressource generation or you can have an army to use the defenses you had no resources to build. On a concept level, the game is good. But it needs significant balancing passes before it plays well. as things stand right now: 3/10 do not buy.","[{'label': '1 star', 'score': 0.4357750117778778}]","[{'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.8614345788955688}]"

110006584,"One of those games where, in its current state, I wish I could give a neutral score. This is obviously a style of game that's been done before, but there's something compelling about fighting off waves of endless hordes. And therein lies the problem. The difficulty ramps up far more quickly than it's possible to cope with. I feel as though the game needs to be more balanced, so you're not overwhelmed by wave 4 on the easiest setting. Of course, it could just be me, and I might well be rubbish at these sort of games, but DINAO just makes it a bit too hard for me. Graphically, well, it's what you'd expect from a game like this. Nice, neat, cute. Sound is nice, with the gruff voices of your soldiers sounding like Englishmen, which is a nice touch for an Englishman like me! Interface is fine, although I'd like to know how much food I was producing/consuming, and it would be nice if the fish regenerated over time. And the forests. Maybe through further research that kind of thing is possible. I'd like to see a larger research tree, but I think that until I can work out a reliable tactic, I'm going to be beaten by wave 4/5 every time, so that's not much time to research new tech. I wish it was more forgiving, which would lead to longer games, and it would be great to have a massive battle combating a massive base that's been gradually constructed over waves. Nice to see a big base being torn down after a lengthy game than a small base being ripped to shreds in 15 mins.

109986932,"This is a review of the game as it was on initial early access release. It contains an endless mode and two campaign missions - further campaign missions are promised. Graphics: The game is gorgeous and runs well on my machine, you can scroll to a very low level of detail and it's enjoyable to watch your little peons run around doing their thing. Gameplay: This game has 3 game modes and the experience is drastically different between them. The 'easy' game mode is the only one where as a player you can actually enjoy building up your settlement and taking time to watch battles/workers. Medium and hard scale up with limited starting resources, more regular and larger waves of enemies. If you want a challenge you will get it in spades. It can be brutal. Having to manually collect magic crystals forces you out of your turtle which is a good bonus for cowardly players like me. HOWEVER - if you enjoy building up a settlement you risk bouncing off this game on anything other than easy as the frantic racing around the screen desperately micro-managing units in your army for peak efficiency, building specific builds in exactly the right order will leave little time for 'enjoying' the colony builder aspect. So you would be right to approach this as a medieval They Are Billions. Content? I'm a little disappointed - the endless mode and two campaign missions feels slightly lightweight. However the game mechanics and breadth of unit types/buildings and enemies I have seen are very impressive and show an extremely sturdy start. Don't leave bodies lying around.

The mechanics are great, building up your base is a joy, it's fun to build up and use your army, and the sheer scale of the large attacks is quite incredible. I see a lot of reviews complaining that Mission 3 (the build boats mission I assume) is a crazy difficulty spike. If you are familiar with how the resource and building system works (which is much more intuitive nowadays and you should pick it up after a couple of games), the mission shouldn't be much trouble. If you use your brain, look at the objectives, see what is required, and act accordingly. The objectives ask you to make a big army to go on the boats, so I focused on making a large army quite early rather than building fortifications, and the mission was no trouble at all.

109960785,"A pretty good They Are Billions clone with several changes that I think improve the game a lot. Has speed settings (unlike TAB) and pause and reasonable zoom (unlike Age of Darkness). Its unique point is the physics simulation, which mostly means if an enemy changes speed or direction during the travel of a projectile you'll miss, shooting over obstacles will reduce accuracy and range, and if your siege engines don't have clear shots they'll often impact terrain dealing no damage to the enemy hordes. While zombies do exist in the game the main enemies you will defend against are actually revolting peasants who have their own siege engines, which can be interesting. The game has several resources of which two are infinite on the map eventually (food and wood, limited in the demo but at tier 2 you can get infinite food and tier 3 infinite wood), two are finite on the map but can be traded for (stone and iron) and one that can only be traded for (gold). The fact that tier one defenses and units as well as some tier 2 units can be recruited for only food and/or wood keep them relevant longer. The game is somewhat buggy currently, and performance apparently is severely impacted on certain CPUs (12th gen i7s I've seen repeatedly), but in the ten hours I've played during the course of playing prior to this review I've found two; A wave spawning on an enclosed area that did not have a path to the rest of the map and the game crashing around day 42. Try the demo, if the basic gameplay appeals to you it's better in the main game due to the content tiers 2 and 3 add. If you don't like the demo at all you probably won't like the game.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.7699291110038757}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.954998254776001}]"

109941555,"A mixture of Age of Empires, Stronghold, They Are Billions and Civilization. And the mixture is in very correct proportions. Gameplay - Many buildings of different levels and their purposes. Variable combat units. Tree of development of strengthenings. Excellent physical model and hence the behavior of the units. Ability to use terrain as a tactical advantage. And that's all training and the first mission. It is extremely pleasant that the main emphasis is placed on the control of troops, since only them need to be ordered, while workers are replenished daily (not always convenient, since sometimes you need to get them right now, however, on the other hand, such an implementation requires a competent expenditure of manpower ) and do everything themselves, only the construction of the necessary buildings is required. Graphics - Very nice low-poly art with, most importantly, the ability to change the viewing angles and camera range during the game, which is sometimes extremely useful in strategies. Music - Atmospheric and fits perfectly with the setting. Plot - So far, only the beginning, but the plot and its presentation hooked from the first minutes. The plot itself is presented in the form of pleasant sketches between missions (similar to the briefing in Stronghold, but with graphics on the game engine). Also a separate respect to the developers for great humor. 10 hillbillies with a pitchfork out of 10","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.7057417035102844}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.6901273727416992}]"

I would suggest adding more resources to fish stone iron as its super tough on endless mode even on labirinth of pain ( i think without certain build order a lot of people can get in HUGE trouble as I have seen first gameplays). I found some bug/glitch that sometimes when i destroy enemy camp still few units spawns few secs after it so it can be a bit decisive if you moved to the town center and dont realise enemy kills your archers ( happened to me more than 10 times in 8h of gameplay), sometimes also enemies after hit with trebuchet/ catapult dissapear for a moment (looks like its no animation when these units try to get up which also can be confusing when you push enemy further). Anyone seeing this don't even consider to not buy this game because its definitely worth to wait to fix it. As I mentioned before stone/iron could be atleast 400-500 resources as in early game is super difficult to get more places to loot these resources. I think once devs will receive more feedback will be easier to them as well to change the game for better! This review is not sponsored and once again THIS GAME IS MASTERPIECE!

109871718,"Quite a fun game! Visuals and art style allow for a fun and nicely executed spin on the survival strategy genre, good job! Amount of content is not that great, but for early access, at this price I'd say its worth supporting this developer. There is a good foundation here to build something really cool, and that was showed ever since the demo. Concern with removing carriers from the game is that it takes away a lot of depth, where there isn't that much in the game as it is now, but hopefully new systems will emerge to replace this mechanic. At the price right now - You are buying a fun experience and supporting a seemingly new dev team. At a sale - Must buy.","[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.7776704430580139}]","[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9303622245788574}]"
