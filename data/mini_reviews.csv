Watched some gameplay of this a long time ago and thought it looked fun, something like They Are Billions.
I was right with what I thought, the game is a blast to play and pretty easy to pick up, coming from someone who doesn't frequent the genre very often.
The difficulty was pretty extreme early on but now that the game is fully out, it seems to be a lot better.
The building is fun, exploring and fighting with your troops is rewarding, the challenge modes and infinite mode are awesome, the campaign (from what I played so far) is good, and lots more to love.
The whole game is fun for anyone who's looking for a game to occupy the horde survival/RTS spot in their library.

All of the resource nodes on the map are depleted quickly. Houses take up a ton of space that you don't have to have people to work with. A lot of food is needed to keep up. 

Then there's the pacing. You're CONSTANTLY being attacked. Especially in the later levels. You have waves that happen every few days, so you're always under the gun. Then you have random buildings on the map that generate mini-waves that hit you from all sides. 

Walls are expensive and very delicate, even at the stone level. You need coins to upgrade to higher levels, which require TONS of base materials (like, 3 coins for 120 wood). Every wave also increases in size and strength. 

It's just a ton to be doing constantly. And a lot of times, you're constrained on space for one reason or another. So your basic army has to clear a bunch of villages to make space. But then you're left wide open for random attacks. And you certainly don't have enough troops to guard your base, because the second a wave is done, you need to be on the offensive and killing stuff. 

If you're too aggressive, your units die, which goes back to needing more resources. I was hoping for something more like We Are Billions, which was a very fun and doable game on lower difficulties. It had some of the same elements where you could screw up a base and need to start over, but once you learned your lesson, you were OK. This game is just rough all around.

The FIRST CASTLE you have to take on is made of stone and loaded with super advanced trebuchets that fire extremely fast and never miss (as compared you to your slow firing, always missing garbage). Also several towers of archers. Oh, and those trebuchets can attack WAY before you're able to and none of your extra powers can damage them. This essentially means you can't move your ranged attacks in close enough before they're utterly decimated by the barrage of fast, heat seeking rocks. It's ridiculous. 

Anyway, I play games to relieve stress, not to build it. So, unfortunately, I'm done with this one. If you like extreme challenges, micro managing everything, and a bunch of game mechanics meant to crush you (disease, depleting resource nodes, expansive building with no protection, constant waves of enemies, etc.) then this game is for you.",1732645574,1732645574,False,5,0,0.572463750839233398,0,True,False,False

And it is. Or rather it was. This game is not for casuals or anyone not willing to invest hours per mission and optimize. The difficulty on ""A walk in the park"" is brutal. The missions require extensive micro play and need to be played optimally: Build order, rushing of specific upgrades, spamming specific units, doing specific tasks in order.

If you imagined a quaint army builder / tower defense were half the joy is to watch the epic battles, prepare for disappointment. You'll be busy snowballing your economy to try to stay ahead of the difficulty curv..cliff.

There is a reason why the achievements have such low completion rates. The tutorial alone will weed most people out. I understand that once somebody figures out the meta, the missions become trivial. Herein lies the problem of the game. It is either too hard or too easy with a hard lean towards the former.

It's cutesy and fun as a colony-building, resource managing game, but it's also easy to lose track of your workforce because halfway through a map they start sucking resources dry really fast. That's one of my main problems with the game; it's GREAT at first when the numbers are small, but then you are asked to macro manage with micromanaging mechanics. That's not a lot of fun

The same can be said about the fighting. It's fun and quantifiable at first but then the enemies start zerging you, and it's hard to keep track of all the variables or have proper management of the situation set up. 

On top of that, there's really no new unlockables. There  *is* the option to change factions multiple times throughout the game which also branches out the storyline, but there are no ""upgrades"". Other similar strategy games (like Kingdom Rush, or TAB) have progress upgrades that unlock new/stronger equipment in later stages. Moreover, you do not have access to all of your assets from the beginning; the games limit you to certain units /towers at first which become stronger and more specialized as the game goes on. Here... neither of these happen. All your assets are available from mission one, and achievable from as soon as mission two. That stagnates the game, whose hours-long missions end up feeling tedious and tiresome. 

I like what is going on at first and I admire the effort that went into the branching campaigns. The scenes in-between missions are also very fun and give the game its own unique character. That said, i do feel tired after having played the missions; the game is a near-hit for me. I suppose i'm recommending it for what could have been.

but includes all the important beats of an RTS like huge armies and walls. When I was a kid, all I wanted to do was create insane cities in Age
of Empires 2 map builder and I always found it disappointing that I couldn't make a 'real' city. This game splits the difference and lets you
enjoy the building aspect and placement despite most of it really not mattering a ton, while still having objectives which can make some of
those sandbox city building type games feel a little empty and pointless.

Lots of trial and error, but it isn't a huge investment to restart so I never mind that. Sure, maybe the game has an annoying way of pathing
the enemy on certain maps. Sure maybe you'll lose because a random attack happened to fall at an inconvenient location/time. Oops! I didn't
build enough builders to keep up with construction so I can't build in time so my people all starve to death because I wasn't on top of food
while I was focused on army stuff. While these things are all frustrating in the moment, especially if you didn't really explicitly do anything
""wrong"", it just fuels your replay where you say ""ah, yeah I should probably clear out this part of the map and put a wall here etc"".

I do wish there were more upgrades and unit variety but I think the game is going for mass over quality. At later points in the game your
troops really meet their match which brings in another trial and error mechanic: Oops, I guess I should focus on taking the fight to the enemy
more often.

Ultimately the one reason I didn't want to play this game is that I was afraid it would be content bare, and to some extent it kindof is, but the
replayability and level variety is sufficient to just pick it up randomly and play through a map. The game doesn't bait me to continue all night
long which I actually like, but it's definitely one of those games to play when I'm killing time more than wanting to fulfill an objective.

9/10

Could use more unit types, cavalry needs some kind of buff, spearmen could use a lategame upgrade like swordsman have, and I wouldn't
mind more trading options to pad resources up or down more than you already can.

Casual enough to enjoy even if you can't quite get into RTS or this newer genre of infinite city defense but complicated enough to actually
play more than 20 hours.",1731767446,1731767446,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Taking place in Medieval fantasy world, you play as gruff and long suffering nobleman referred to, even by his closest advisors and friends, as 'The Lord'. As such it is your duty command your people and guide them to glory, growing from a scant handful of foot-soldiers and berry pickers into a vast economic machine that turns raw resources into an unstoppable army of knights, towers, and war machines.

Having played the game for a significant amount of time, completing one campaign, and being mid-way through others, I feel like I have divined the single word which best describes DNO's style and strength within the RTS landscape. That word is 'Simplicity'. Rather than creating a sprawling morass of game mechanics, DNO instead strips down the administrative and inconsequential bloat of other designs and instead builds a highly focussed game style. You, for the most part, play as a single classic medieval faction made of knights, swordsman, archers, castles, catapults, and the like. These forces must be trained or built using classical resources of wood, stone, metal and gold, gathered from the surrounds or traded for.

The game has to major modes, the story Campaign and an Endless mode. The main goal in both is much the same, build up a meagre starting force into one which can not only defend itself but also crush your enemies and bring their cities and fortifications tumbling to the ground. My focus was primarily on the campaign, where you are presented with individual missions, sometimes with more complex objectives. While in effect, most missions involve obliterating your enemy, sub objectives or specific targets change the players focus, and create a surprisingly deep need for tactics and strategy beyond simply amassing an army.

Indeed, while material resources are needed to grow your army, there are three other major resources which DNO uses to drive gameplay and create difficulty for the player. The first two are food and people. As a Lord, you have dominion over your growing city, and growing is what it must do to survive. Every soldier, farmer, fisher, etc. needs to be fed and housed. More houses means more people. More people need more food. More food needs more land. And, a bigger army needs more people, more resources, and more defenses. DNO uses this simple chain, like many other RTS games do, but adds in an additional element which forces the player to work efficiently and try to roll this economic boulder down the hill. This final resource, is time, and it is an ever dwindling resource.

That may sound trite, but DNO really does have a sharp and ever present focus on the passage of time. At the top left of your screen you'll see a slowly turning disc representing day and night, each one meticulously counted. In the bottom left, right beside your map is a counter showing when new enemies will next attempt to storm your city. Each one of these assaults is a horde of enemies marching towards your settlement, and they only grow with time. DNO does not allow complacency. Each moment should be put to work, and despite the games apparent focus on defensive battle, the most success is often found by being aggressive.

Take too long, fail to clear out enemies fast enough, or build up your own military too slow, and the next horde will wipe you out completely. Even knowing where and when an enemy will hit you is only a small strategic boon. Knowing these things will help you place your defences, walls and warriors, but to win you'll need more that just raw strength. Often, your army will be vastly outnumbered by incoming enemies, while your offensive targets will often be frustratingly robust. So, your greatest strength is in fact your player intelligence.

DNO has active pausing, letting you stop time at any point and give orders. Battles are not won by simply steam rolling the enemy with a superior wall of meat and metal, but by careful coordination of positions, formations, and movements. Enclosing an enemy will limit their movement and damage output, and the bunched up core of their forces struggle to reach the front, replacing the limited frontline as they mauled by yours. Siege equipment and marksman can be placed on fixed towers, raining death on enemies as they scramble to take down walls or maneuver around obstacles, bleeding them out. A well thought out number of healers and choke points can turn a handful of soldiers into an unbreakable wall of steel and death, cutting down entire armies as they flood towards you. DNO asks the player to embrace all these, and more. It is an RTS which feels highly tactical, and more than a simple measure of army sizes.

This methodology of building on simple base mechanics, using what you have intelligently, is the real shining star for DNO. The tech-tree is similarly basic. Each major building expands the tree to provide more improvements for it's own units. These are understandable and useful, such as the speed at which resource gatherers move, which is needed for collecting and depositing materials at your various depots. The speed of building and builders, which become increasingly important as you expand, with builders rushing between sites and buildings needing to be completed before the next day dawns. Soldiers and siege gear increase in range, health, damage, a few special abilities, and training times. All these things are easily understandable, and give real improvements to you while still keeping things simple.

Even graphically, the game is simple and polygonal, redolent of early RTS games. This not only allows computing power to be devoted to the massive number of units that are present in any major combat, but also moves to make everything easily recognizable. DNO leans into this artistic style, opting for a cartoonish design which I found very appealing, and shows that stylistic design can be every bit as visually enjoyable and hyper-realistic games if done boldly and sincerely.

I will say, however, DNO can be very unforgiving. It can feel disheartening to spend hours on a mission only to realize the economic engine you've created doesn't have enough power or speed to beat you the level, and their is little recourse but to start over and plan better next time. I am playing on the normal difficulty, and have had a number of these moments as I learned to break out of my defensive and passive mindset.

If you love stories of classic fantasy, with some comedy thrown in, but also love a challenging strategic war gaming experience, DNO will probably have something that you'll really enjoy. You can spend a great deal of time in just the campaign, and the endless mode expands this experience massively, and gives the opportunity for some battles of a truly epic scale. Overall, DNO is an RTS I have truly enjoyed, despite my own amateur skill in the genre.",1731364620,1731364620,True,2,0,0.494809657335281372,0,True,False,False

Campaign (Main chunk of content here) relies on YOU assaulting enemy bases (Compared to trailers which show you defending yourself from enemy forces). There are a few defense missions, yes, and they are the best. 

For assaults though... Let's give you some simple math as example. Trebuchet, a legendary siege known to most fans of medieval games. Enemy towers in last mission have up to 3000 HP (Range is about between 1200 and 3000). So you think ""Well, it is trebuchet time"". Only that... Trebuchets deal 45 damage per impact. 45 (!). So, to destroy *a* tower you need around 67 shots from trebuchets. And final level is full of these towers. And enemy will retaliate in the mean time, hell, good chance their own siege engines (With higher damage) will counter your trebuchets. 

And it is just an example of missions where you are the attacker. Game has plenty of tools for defensive playstyle, but barely for attacking. And there is planty of attacking to be done. 

Okay, you say. Then you still can micro all of these, right? No, you can't. Pathfinding and target finding is this game are worse than in Starcraft 1. Simple example - if you give attack move command, your units will attack empty walls and buildings, even if enemy units are around. Target priority ""units > buildings"" was solved decades ago for RTS, what is this?

But then you might say ""well then, just manually click what you want to attack"". Only that units will always choose worst path for attacking, they will stack in each other, blocking attack pathes for on another. 

Overall, it is very  *frustrating* experience. Games tries to be what it isn't, and thus falls apart. Bleh",1731174722,1731174722,False,16,0,0.560492277145385742,0,True,False,False

I'm always down for a new RTS, this is very reminiscent of They Are Billions, only in a lighter more comedic tone with less OP individual units. It definitely scratches the itch for RTS mixed with Tower Defense.

I highly recommend it, 

So you'll understand the loop: there is no ramp up through the campaign for new buildings or anything, it's always an individual race to level up to the third building level and create large defense obstacles between ""mountains"" to push enemies into small areas so you can use your god powers to wipe them out, your units are nominally stronger than the enemy but their numbers can quickly overwhelm you. Usually though you can usually take your time to do just upgrade at ""leisure"" with regular bandit raids throughout depending on your difficulty. The harder levels can be quite brutal though!

The campaign doesn't have any special player buildings or considerations aside from enemy building/unit types, but there are some interesting wrinkles on a few of the missions that keep it fun and interesting. Also the comedy is well done if occasionally grammatically incorrect.

The visuals are quite nice, I personally have some fairly robust computers so I've never had any issues with too many sprites or system lag, but I'm not sure about older systems.

sweet mechanics
player friendly UI
player empowering design
brutal testing if you grasped things like ''build massive defences & armies or die''

rambling details

something to compare it with ? say stronhold but larger scale

example of sweet mechanics

most of them is pure ingame resource based no silly ''only 5 of these'' , you got the iron & gold ? well go hogwild with knights then mate! but likewise there are delicious 'organic' details sprinkled in such as for example , your citizens needs food or they start die yes ? ...so do your soldiers ,and the dead are ehm , reeeeestlesssss hehehe

example of player friendly ui

you chose if you want to decide what buildings gets repaired , oooooor , just declare builders to repair everything they can reach

example of player empowering design

as stated , no forced iron man mode , you got 100% control of your classic style saved games etc

example of the brutal design

as some others wrote ''there is a serious difficulty spike at mission 3 , suddenly you go from'clean map with your little squad' to 'here comes THE HORDE!'' but , this is honestly not as much of a 'spike' as some claims compare it to stronghold and those that only ever played vs the rat ''aka the most incompetent of the AI's'' and those that played vs the other ones or humans , one group will be baffled that they are resisted at all the other just says dam , i was a bit slow on getting those walls and crossbows up

and , vastly superior to for example they are billions NO FORCED IRON MAN CRAP! if you are trying decide between these two games pick this instead
YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF YOUR SAVED GAMES ETC , only down side is you have to make extra 'users' to explore alternative decision paths in the campaign but thats trivial",1730655572,1730655572,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even reminds me a little bit of Settlers 3+4 mixed with stronghold and tower defence. It is is in a decent state, but not perfect. I hadn't had any crashes so far, but the pathfinding of the settlers has bricked quite a few times, when the settlement got bigger.

The campaign is fun so far, I have played through it about halfway this far. To those people that complain about the difficulty, I get where you are coming from. I don't think, that the game itself is too hard, but it does a pretty bad job of teaching you to scale up your base. I had to watch a video of people playing an the hardest difficulties, to see their build order. After that, it became the ""walk in the park"" it promised, but this should be tought through gameplay and not by watching other people. 
A fix for that could maybe be a small prologue campaign that serves as an extended tutorial, that forces you to build larger economies. Right now, the fourth (if memory serves right) mission of the campaign, where you have to build those boats, is the first mission, where you have to expand to townhall lvl3, having to use the market and whilst beeing under pressure, Which results in quite a difficulty spike, until you have figured those mechanics out. The fact, that the maps are randomly generated, doesn't really help with it, when you are already struggling with figuring out your build order and then also having to adapt it to the maps surcomstances on the fly. I understand, why that is but maybe give an option to play with a fixed seed on lower difficulties?

All in all a fun game, when you have figured out how it works. that ""Figuring out"" process is needlessly frustrating, but the game still has a lot of potential to get even better, then it already is.

It's exhausting. The pacing is terrible. Just constant pings everywhere because you're being attacked from every direction and you have to check every single ping in case this time it's a big wave and you need to do some micro. Up until this mission the game would mostly let you know when an attack was coming and outside that window you could focus on macro. If you're familiar with the final mission in Wings of Liberty it's like that but you're attacked from any direction often 6+ attacks happening at any one time and the mission takes 3 or more hours.
There's a cool magic system except the game doesn't give you a way to reliably get the resource for it until the last tech tree and even when you do the place you have to build it is invariably way outside your fortress and the maximum rate is pathetic so you may as well not bother.
The early game is frustrating once the random spawns start because there's no way you can afford to build walls for every direction so again you're constantly managing individual units to fend off attacks and if you miss a single attack the normal buildings in this game are made of paper mache and get destroyed in half a nanosecond. Visibility is atrocious until tech tier 2 so your first minimap vision of an attack is a single red pixel about 2 seconds before it starts destroying your buildings.
Small gripe but the screenshots and trailer are not particularly representative of a real game. The sheer amount of stuff would be comically expensive to build. It's not impossible but the base would cover half the map not a small box around the town hall. Related but in the trailer they're throwing out half a dozen meteors like that stuff is free on tap. You're lucky if you get 6 in a whole mission.
To be clear I like a difficult RTS. I've enjoyed trying and retrying missions, different strats, better macro, etc. This whole ""attacked from all directions"" gameplay is fun. But do it continuously for hours and all it's doing is raising my cortisol.

Unfortunately, there are a million little things that annoy me here, that eventually made playing this frustrating.

[h1]The Economy[/h1]
On paper, it's pretty classic. Food, wood, stone, iron, and later on you can trade for gold. Your guys collect stuff, deposit it in a local stockpile (provided there's room) and repeat. But in practice it creates a new layer of unnecessary complexity; having stockpiles in the right places, with the right settings, and having to constantly move them around because you keep clearing out forests... it's a little less annoying with stone and iron as these resources stay in one place for a pretty long time, but it's still the same problem.

Then there's food. Long story short, it's pretty hard to tell how much exactly do you produce and how much do you need (to keep growing, you know how much you need to sustain yourself). There is a graph screen that helps you with this, but even then, planning becomes an approximation. 

And of course, farms need SPACE. Lots of space.

[h1]The Space[/h1]
Just like in They Are Billions, you have to keep expanding your town by clearing out enemies. In TAB it made sense, there were zombies everywhere, obviously you need to clear the place. But here there are enemy encampments just 'cause. Feels a little weird, but whatever.

My main issue is that it always felt like there's not enough room. Ok, I need houses, farms, production facilities, military buildings. So no problem, just go expand, right? But aha, two issues here. One - the resources are somewhat sparse, you probably can't afford to just move your walls every few days. And two - the further you go, the more fortifications the enemy has. Not bases, just random towers full of archers. 

So there is a point where you can't just go around and kill stuff, unless you're ok with throwing units at the wall, not worried about casualties. But here's the problem with this approach.

[h1]The Corpses[/h1]
Whenever any of your people die - whether civilians or soldiers - they have to be buried, or else they'll generate disease. Your gravediggers will be walking around, collecting corpses and putting them in the designated graveyards. Curiously, only your people have to be buried, I guess the corpses of the attacking masses are disease-free or something. Anyway, let's say that a bunch of your soldiers died in an attack, and the location remains unconquered. There are bodies there. What do you do?

Option 1: You send your gravediggers anyway. You might be successful, but a more likely outcome is that the gravediggers will just join the other corpses, since there are archers in the area.

Option 2: You just let the bodies rot there. That's fine if you don't plan on expanding there, but you'll keep having an annoying notification that there are corpses to be buried - a notification that you otherwise should pay attention to.

And even if you're just burying regular soldiers that died during an enemy attack, it's still a pain, even if you have a bunch of gravediggers on the ready. Oh, and make sure the graveyards themselves are safely tucked away, because they die in pretty much one hit and once destroyed, all the corpses you've buried there will instantly rise as annoying undead.

[h1]The Concept[/h1]
So instead of having a more faction VS faction type of combat here, you have your units and the enemies are weaker but far, far more numerous. Again, like in They Are Billions. I feel like it makes no sense here, except to create this ""sea of enemies at our walls"" feeling which I personally don't care for. This works when your enemies are zombies or monsters or something, but here? Our guys with a sword are three times stronger than their guys with a sword! Can't we just have them equal and have smaller numbers?

Also, uh, the... humour. It's a little like Monty Python but relying almost entirely on the comical pause. Oh, a weird situation. Characters just stare at each other for literally 5 seconds and say nothing. There are exceptions to this, some moments made me laugh, but otherwise the timing is bad, the jokes themselves are a mixed bag...

Let me say for the record that I highly prefer British humour to American one (no, I'm not British, I don't even speak English actually) but even the Britishness is not enough to make these awful jokes work. But that might just be my personal taste speaking.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
All the time when playing this, I was thinking ""I wish I was playing They Are Billions instead"". So I eventually went and played a game and it was such a breath of fresh air. You can see the clear line of influences, but there the things just work.

Diplomacy Is Not An Option is an attempt, but one that fails, if you ask me. I think it's a noble one, however; so I feel a little bad for this scathing critique. Still, know what you're getting into.

Люблю проходить стратегии на нормальном уровне сложности без пота, но и с определенным челленджом.
DiNO купил летом до выхода кампании. Испытания приятно удивили, но после трех уровней сделал паузу и решил дождаться кампании.  
Прошел примерно середину кампании и могу отметить следующие плюсы:
-Ненапряжная легкая сюжетка с небольшими приколами
-Приятная графика 
-Постройка экономии очень залипательная и приятная
Есть небольшая вариативность, но вместе с этим есть и минусы:
По сути весь геймплей кампании это изучай карту и отбивайся от атак, и вместе с этим иногда возникают что то дополнительное: собери, убей, построй. С самого старта игры доступны все постройки и все армии с исследованиями и каждую миссию, каждый раз нужна заново начинать изучать ветку и отстраивать с нуля поселение. Механически это интересно, но вот если любите играть 2-3 часа, то это приедается. Здесь хорошим примером мог бы послужить тот же Старкрафт: развитие исследований в самой кампании НА всю кампанию, открытие новых юнитов, зданий, улучшений и т.д. Тогда мы история воспринималась более цельно и органично, присутствовало бы чувство развития и связанности между миссиями, а так получается, что мы просто смотреть сценку, и начинаем отсраивать базу, армию и исследования сначала. Всех победили. Снова сцена и снова все с самого нуля. В общем вы поняли.

It has a lot of content; there's a full campaign, endless modes, sandbox mode, etc. Sandbox is quite fun; you can set up the exact conditions you want to play with: map size, type, enemy variety, cheats, and on and on.

Ok they finished that fishing shack in town nearby now they will build the wall? No sorry workers cant reach buildres guild.

So far I have only been doing campaign missions (there are also challenge, sandbox and endless modes). The missions are long (~4h) and have branching paths and maps are randomly generated so there is high replay value. I think I won't finish my first campaign run at least until I am 80 hours in.

Even though the game markets itself primary as a tower defense survive the hordes type game, there are objectives that force you to be the attacker while also still keeping the hordes in check (depending on the game mode ofc) and i really like those gameplay shakeups. Like having a boss mob with a high pool of health to kill (don't skip the concert :)).

The story doesn't take itself too seriously, but still manages to be engaging and good fun.

The only gripe I have is that I am unsure what the difficulty settings affect (only enemy spawn rates? maybe also map generation?). The campaign also ramps up difficulty by default the more you progress but some general tooltip that explains each difficulty mode changes would be nice. So far I gathered that it affects the number of objectives to complete later campaign missions, the size of the hordes and your starting resources/army. I will stick to the medium difficulty going forward I guess.

If you are on the fence, I suggest giving it a try. So far this is a 9/10 for me and RTS type games don't usually click for me.

JUST as i started thinking it may be a bit to shallow for my taste, the next mission had a whole set of new perimeters, units, and game play! 

Its really cool that the game gives you choices that totally change your campaign experience and allow for a fair amount of replayability, and I really look forward to what the devs add next!

Its not that often where modern games force you to figure stuff out on the fly and cause you to have to use actual STRATEGY to win, but this game is tough enough to make you work for it!

This game isn't a true wave defending game such as cataclismo it leans a lot closer to a rts like starcraft but you can build walls and there are in game days (a day being around 3 min in game) that pass. After every few days a wave of enemies will come and attack your base and the waves get harder and harder the more days that pass. This wave defending mechanic happens passively along side the main campaign objective so there is some urgency built in.


While this is an interesting take on the rts genre it does come with some frustrating moments and long drawn out campaign missions.
Most campaign missions usually boil down to kill this thing but the thing that you are killing is surrounded by so many enemies you have to tech into super late game to beat it which takes a long time. With the increasing harder waves you are forced to play very efficient or the waves eventually get to hard and you fail. Due to the urgency of the waves you end up doing the same build order all the way to late game because that is the only way to win. Which leads to repetitive gameplay. Besides the waves of enemies there are passive enemies littered around the map and they don't harass you so the game gives you no incentive to change up your playstyle.


You have to savescum a lot in this game because some campaign objectives tell you to find this thing and if you get unlucky finding it then the waves of enemy will eventually kill you because you took to long. The campaign maps are randomly generated too so you can't take the knowledge you learnt from a failed attempt and get better because now the thing your trying to find is in a different location.
The actual mechanic of wave of enemies trying to attack your base periodically also leads to some frustrating moments. If you pan your camera to a fog of war area that area is pitch black, its not like other rts where you can still see the terrain but cant see enemies or buildings. The game will tell you on the edge of the minimap where the wave is coming. There are cliffs and large bodies of water (remember you cant see in the fog of war) that will change the pathing of the enemies. You end up having to ""guess"" where they will come and build a wall. Early on building walls is expensive so you have to build a short wall and if you guess wrong because you didn't know there was a cliff in the fog of war which caused the enemy pathing to move to the left then guess what your going to reload your save.

The concept is cool, it was fun early on but later on it gets repetitive and drawn out and you can lose not because you didn't have the right unit composition or didn't play well but because you guessed wrong on where the enemies will path to get to your base.",1729299499,1729299499,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the city building mechanics/options are genuinely great in their own right - stacked on top of a tower defense design that elevates everything to a whole other level.

after 20+ hours i havent even experienced of those Lord of the Rings style mega-battles - because im still trying to protect my base from utter implosion from smaller waves coming from all sides. those large battles were the reason i was so intrigued by the game to start with.

It takes forever to gather resources, making base building slow and cumbersome; all the while you're being attacked by stronger and stronger waves. Some mission goals for resources are insanely high as well. Upgrading townhall from level 1-2 takes 150 wood. From 2-3 takes 600, in addition to stone, iron and money. 

The timing on cutscenes is also really bad, to the point were I just started skipping all of them, even though there is come good comedy. Imagine you're having a conversation with someone but they only speak one sentence every 4-5 seconds but maintain eye contact with you the whole time.

The game's pacing needs serious work and now that it's 1.0 I doubt it will improve.

- Audio is far less annoying

- Kiting enemies still works extremely well but is just annoying and time consuming to do. even more so since there is no shift-click pathing option. I wish kiting enemies wasn't helpful and part of the core harder difficulty gameplay. 
- I wish the military units were better at auto picking up nearby items/drops on the map. Again, just really annoying have to take one unit and tell them to go pick up the thing again and again.

*Diplomacy is Not an Option* is a compelling mix of 4X strategy and real-time tactics, blending exploration, expansion, and large-scale battles with a medieval fantasy setting. The game’s primary appeal lies in its deep 4X mechanics and wry humor, setting it apart from typical defense-based titles. Here’s a breakdown of what makes this game stand out—and where it still has room for improvement.

### Pros

1. **Unique Storytelling and Humor**: The game’s storytelling shines with a dry humor that’s both subtle and effective. Its “less-is-more” approach to dark comedy adds charm, making the otherwise intense battles feel lighter and more engaging.

2. **Thoughtfully Designed Campaign**: Each campaign mission is distinctly crafted, with objectives that feel varied and well-paced. After 11 hours of gameplay, I’ve appreciated the lack of repetition in missions, and the difficulty ramps up in ways that keep me constantly strategizing.

3. **Strong 4X Elements**: The game masterfully incorporates core 4X traits—exploration, expansion, exploitation, and extermination—despite being marketed as a defense title. Many missions require you to leave your base and hunt down bosses, feeling more like an RTS or a 4X game than a typical tower-defense experience. Compared to recent similar games like *Frostpunk 2*, *Diplomacy is Not an Option* stands out with its intense resource management and varied gameplay.

4. **Flexible Battle Strategies**: Crossbowmen are an invaluable asset, providing versatile support and high damage output. I’d recommend making them at least half of your army for most missions, as their range and reliability make them a crucial element of my defensive tactics.

### Cons

1. **Limited Accessibility to Multiple Endings**: Although the game features multiple endings, returning to specific branching points is cumbersome. Making these choices easier to revisit would greatly enhance replayability, as it’s currently too time-consuming to experience each outcome.

2. **Unit AI Needs Refinement**: A common issue in combat is ranged units clustering their fire on a single target, leading to wasted damage output. Improving AI accuracy to spread attacks more effectively would streamline battles and make resource management easier.

3. **Lacks Mod Support**: Modding support, particularly through Steam Workshop, would be a game-changer. Community-created mods could offer balance tweaks, new maps, or extended content, which would expand the game’s lifespan and appeal to more players.

4. **Population Management Constraints**: Population serves as a crucial and limited resource, making expansion and defense planning difficult. Having defensive structures that don’t consume population would add flexibility, letting players strengthen their defenses without hindering their economy.

### Final Verdict

In sum, *Diplomacy is Not an Option* delivers a memorable and challenging experience for fans of 4X and RTS games, blending strategy, humor, and engaging gameplay. While improvements to unit AI, mod support, and branching options would elevate the game, it’s still a standout in the genre. **Rating: 8/10**—an exciting choice for strategy fans with a taste for depth and dark humor, but with some polish still needed.",1729088079,1729862096,True,2,0,0.535080313682556152,0,True,False,False

DNO is a They Are Billions style game, for better and worse. It's not any lesser, nor is it a clone, but instead has its own style and quirks that set it apart. However, the entire game is about perfecting a build order, where you clear and build up a map in preparation for waves of attackers. There are two issues with this style of game that make it not for everyone.

The first is that snowballing is incredibly important. Small gains and optimisations snowball into major changes an hour later. Getting an hour or two in and finding that you just can't win, means starting over from the very beginning. Just the time investment in such long playtime is not for everyone, and being forced to do it again can cause a lot of frustration.

The second is that the game is an optimisation problem. Should you be selling wood or food? Building two or three foresters on the first day? None of this is apparent to the average person, and so getting better is often just not possible because the game doesn't provide you that feedback. Instead, getting better is done by looking up spreadsheets and build orders. This is the kind of thing that makes competitive RTS games toxic and unfun, and yet that is the path this singleplayer game has chosen.

Awkward pacing, QOL, and balance.
DNO suffers from a pacing issue, whether it be in the gameplay, or even in the cutscenes. Certain moments feel like a mad scramble of multitasking and chaos, but most of the game is spent waiting around. Sure, you can pause and fast forward, but that is a crutch rather than a solution to sloppy game design. Worse and most blatant are the story cutscenes, filled with long drawn out pauses that make them take 3x longer than they should. The dialog isn't that clever, and nothing is actually happening so they just feel painful to sit through and watch.

QOL features could be vastly improved. The tech tree specifically feels awkward to use, needing to be reopened every time a research item finished. Easy to miss that and go half an hour without remembering to do research. There is no reason why there couldn't be a queue, or even simultaneous researches. Having to save scum to get to different paths in the story is also bizarre.

Game balance is a mess, and I hope the devs actually take this complaint seriously. I'm not alone with finding certain levels to be poorly balanced with massive difficulty spikes, but the responses to these concerns has been, concerning.

I will still recommend the game for the sandbox and other stuff but the campaign is a bit crazy and hard to enjoy if you pick the easier options. Feels like they wanted to make a dark souls RTS base defense story which does not work well.

As an avid RTS gamer in my 30s, who gravitates towards playing every game at the highest difficulty, I'm glad I read some posts on the Reddit first and stuck to medium. Man, it was hard.

My favorite thing about this game is how it constantly challenges your expectations. Much higher difficulty than your average game. Really off-putting pacing in the cut scenes, just for fun. Unique art style, interesting take on translations, and little eccentricities everywhere like never showing the lord's face (going so far as to have a blurred face texture on his in-game unit). The game has a lot of character.

I'd compare it most closely to They Are Billions, but it plays quite differently. Gone is the annoying challenge of constantly inching your units forward to clear the map, every single map. You might have to do it once or twice, but each mission has different challenges - some are focused on the waves, some are focused on clearing spawners, some are focused on assaulting a fortified position, some have just a single very difficult final wave. It was interesting to need to adapt each time.

My biggest complaint about the game is simply the pathfinding AI - units tend to clump up instead of spreading evenly. It's especially annoying with your own units, because it makes them much less effective in combat without micro. But it also feels a little weird that the AI will happily beat on a 5 layer wall directly in front of them instead of just walking around. But to be honest, that's a pretty small complaint given the scope of this game. It's overall quite polished.

  Some things i would love to see in future updates would be things like ladder enemy's or other units that circumvent walls in different ways or maybe even the ability to dig trenches or moats. I do think it dose need a few more ''bits and bobs"" for late game as things like endless mode have you max tier rather quickly, which is great for keeping the game simple and for shorter rounds but, would love something shiny in later endless mode games like special units or buildings. I also would love to see visual representation of damage to walls and buildings to see them barely standing at the end of the wave or crumble to dust as you get swarmed. Multiplayer would also be fun. i think verses or co-op would bring whole new layers of fun to an already great game. 

highly recommend this game, it is both fun easy to learn but puts up a great challenge and has excellent pick up and put down capability.",1728838079,1728838079,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TlDR version (no spoilers): From what I could see and play, you start your campaign as the loyal subject of the king and can decide where you want to go from there (faction wise). There are some missions, which play differently (escort campaigns with only troops, escape missions with only 3-4 units, etc.), but the vast majority of the campaigns are with you starting with 1-2 buildings, a few troops and an unexplored map. 

The gameplay loop in general is you stopping waves of enemies coming at various times, while trying to achieve certain goals (build x ships, find and rescue y, hold out until z). 

To break down the pros and cons:

pro:
-entertaining story
-easy to play and plan out. You dont need any tutorials.
-huge waves of units and a decent amount of unit variety on your side. 

cons:
-your tech tree resets
-lack of enemy units variety (which is not a big deal for this game)
-monotone gameplay-loop.
-Damage sponges on some maps.
-no gold generation

The damage sponges are straight up unbalanced (Ozzy here). You can still defeat him with various strategies (e.g. kiting with melee units), but units like him have too much HP and deal too much dps. I would get it, if he was some kind of end-game boss, but he isnt. He is somewhere in the middle of the campaign. Of 2 campaigns from what I could see so far. 

The monotone gameplay loop and the reset of the tech tree on each new level is something that makes the experience worse. This is a missed opportunity. Instead of resetting the tech-tree, it would have been far more enjoyable, if the tech took longer, but was permanent on the entire campaign and if certain buildings only unlocked at certain points in the story. 

E.g. why not make a university an objective at one point in the campaign, so people build the specific building? Why not unlock all buildings gradually through the campaign?

It would most certainly make the gameplay loop feel different through the campaign, because you would have to deal with the existing problem in different ways. As it stands now, what I usually do is too rush through the first tech (townhall level 1) to get to the second tech (townhall level 2), where I pump my production up to reach the last tech (townhall level 3) as fast as possible in order to get the strong units and production facilities. There is really no reason to stay at the lower 2 tech levels and the only thing they do is to hamper your ressource production and lock you out of crucial units. 

Finally, the only way for you to get to money is through trade. I can understand why tax is not a thing, but at least put a tavern (which btw exist in the game) that generates like a couple of gold coins per day.

I had 30+ hours in the pre 1.0 release so I understood the games mechanics going into the campaign, but I'm at a point (about half way through) where I cannot progress, despite being on the easiest difficulty, as there is not enough time to extract resources so that you can build good defenses.

This isn't a problem with just the level I'm currently on either. This has been a reoccurring theme where you have to scramble to set up enough resource buildings so you can build your army large enough to defeat enemy waves that attack from random directions. If you don't get enough resources in time, then you can't build good buildings, and then can't build good armies, and then game will crush you with endless waves of enemies that get larger even if you're struggling to rebuild from the last wave. 

It's very frustrating when you put hours into building a great city, when it only takes a few small groups of weak enemies, attacking from many different directions, to destroy enough of your buildings so that your resources are drained and are defenseless against the next enemy wave.

I really wish I could give a positive review because a lot of effort has been put into this game and at times it is fun to play, but the game is a sweatfest even at the easiest difficulty.

Did some campaign, played around in a sandbox level so I could see under the hood a bit, and first I wanna say that it's a great game. Plays smooth, didn't see a single bug, no problems understanding how it works and what you need to do. But now comes he one thing I've discovered that's not good. I haven't done a bunch of testing or anything like that so maybe this was a one and done kind of deal? But it didn't seem like that as it took place. So the AI is attacking me, I've got my troops held up in a defensive gateway, it's actually a double wall and double gate set up and they are just starting to attack me. They take down a tower full of archers. Good job! They're probably gonna take down the second tower of archers next and then move past the now broken wall and start trying to get past wall #2 and it's guardians, right? No. The AI sat there beating on every piece of the first wall until all of it had been destroyed. It didn't make the other tower full of archers, shooting at their army, the next target either. Nope, it was the next section of wall, then the next one, and the next one, until they reached the tower. Once it too was destroyed and there was no furthe threat from this wall what so ever, I mean it's not even blocking the way anymore, yet that didn't stop them from their mission to see that this wooden wall would never bar someone's way ever again by wiping it from the face of the Earth forever! As the AI destroyed piece after piece of the wall the guardians and siege weapons on and behind wall #2 continued to hammer them . They should have been able to breach both walls with their number and strength of troops. But because of this broken AI, they were destroyed just after they completed their mission of destroying the entire wooden wall. Now like I said, this was once and I haven't tried to repeat the issue. Maybe it was a random one time thing, but it's didn't seem like it at the time. It just seemed like the AI thought it needed to clear the wall before it could move on, and that would be basically game breaking for the AI to be that bad in an RTS. So I wanted to share the experience and maybe it helps fix an issue with an otherwise outstanding game.

   **Played it a bit more tonight and not only did I see some of the same poor AI logic, but my forces would be not far from the enemy, who were attacking some poor, helpless, little berry pickers and they just stood there. I also noticed that if enemy were around a corner, my troops would act as if they just had no clue they were there. Despite the tower of archers right next to them shooting arrows down at the enemy, while they bashed on a stone tower, trying to bring it down. Nope can't see em directly so we can't help out, sorry guys. Until we get some orders we're just gonna hang here, just around the corner. 
   
   The AI needs work and it needs to be the priority of the Devs if they truly want to put out a good product. I don't like to give bad reviews and this should be a very cool game. But unless they do something about the silly AI, I can't suggest this game. I've played many RTS in my life and one of the most important pieces needed to make a good one is a functioning AI that works well at each of the difficulty levels. This game just does not have that. 

  I also noticed that there is a very limited amount of food on the maps that I've played. So much so that it limits your army's size when compared with the army you're facing. Now that may be a difficulty aspect of choosing to side with the people rather then the king, and I just got my butt kicked. But it felt like there just was not enough food to build up enough troops to face the final round, and that's after I cleared all starting forces from the map. It's also super silly to have fishing locations that just completely run out of fish after a matter of days. I mean come on guys, we've been fishing the waters of this planet for thousands of years, feeding WAY more people then the 200-300 or so people in my little fort and we're still not out of fish! Part of the skill of fishing is knowing how to not over fish so they can continue to make more fish. But the food part could be my fault so take this part as just opinion. Now the AI thing, all of the AI stuff I've talked about, I've watched everything I've describe in this review with my own eyes and I've seen other reviews talking about it too.

Horribly finite resources make building any sort of capable defenses tedious and a considerable struggle. Level 4 was certainly difficult but the levels thereafter are even worse, even after the update. Honestly, the game just isn't fun and needs to be re-balanced, regardless of what the dev might say. 

My suggestions:
- Improve missile AI to better engage targets. Right now, you could have 100 archers shooting at the same enemy and all of the arrows aren't connecting because of the weird positioning. A tower's position along a wall shouldn't lose an entire run because you realized too late all of your arrows will just miss. Is there any real reason for arrow collision other than to frustrate the player?

- Resource nodes could use a significant bump. I understand wanting the player to expand to gain resources, but the amount of resources given means you cannot adequately defend any new positions taken. The gold mechanic required to tech up just exacerbates this issue. At the present, I can see resource nodes being bumped by at least 30% and the game still being very difficult. 

- If resource nodes aren't adjusted, then the gold mechanic is too brutal. Introducing a way to generate gold passively either through a new tax building or node could help the situation and give players a chance to get their economy going before getting overwhelmed. At present, a player is required to dump insane amounts of resources into the market just to get to tier 3, then not be able to afford anything tier 3 has to offer before all of the nodes nearby are dry. 

- I would say lessening the amount of enemy units should be the last option for balancing, considering the theme of the game. The player should just be given more tools and resources to handle the enemies presented. Buffing player units would be a better solution. Either expand the research upgrades each unit can receive, or perhaps introduce a veterancy system for units to be able to better handle the enemies that they are thrown against, which could buff units based on kills.

The fact you could probably implement all of these suggestions and the game would *still* be difficult is a testament to how difficult the game is in its current state.",1728624191,1728624191,False,12,1,0.53142857551574707,0,True,False,False

Many things are similar but with an added twist or improvement. Just to mention a few of the things that I really liked:
- You can put archers on the walls
- Opening the gates can let enemies pass through

Resource Management is very well thought out and quite deep:
- upkeep + finite resources + transportation from source to storage + sickness/burial of dead troops

Just a few suggestions that can maybe make it more realistic:
- zombies (yes, zombies!) will always attack you even though they spawned beside enemy camps
- random hordes / scouts (enemies in the map just stay in their camps - although I've only played a few levels in the game, this might be true for advanced levels)

I tried out the Sarranga missions where you're starving and and have to fight the god that spawns and also kill two nightmare generals.

I don't hate the starvation aspect of the bug maps but i'm not sure how you're supposed to raise a big enough army to fight the generals and gods that spawn. My solution was to just cheese it with healers and one melee guy but that's just not fun.

The god has an aoe which kills all your dudes so you rely on healers to heal one melee dude. That's not a terrible situation but it's boring and you basically 3x speed until the day is over.

Fighting the nightmare generals is the exact same fight because they too kill all your melee guys with an aoe so it's another boring fight of kiting one troop around while it gets ranged to death.

There are some frustrations about the way you are forced to play, even on the lowest difficulty.

Farms for example, take up way too much space which makes them hard to use early, and if you do, likely you will be ripping up trees, which are also a finite resource.

For context I played semi comp Supreme Commander and CoH, so i'm fairly experienced when it comes to RTS micro but also grander scale and have therefore certain expectations to controls and the sort.

All it is at some point is just to build faster and faster and faster (so the economy is done like an ECO Rts like AoE) in hopes to beat the aritficial difficulty. While painfully microing around mistakes that you only discover when the hordes of enemies are at your footstep (Like a low unit RTS like CoH).

But since the enemy doesn't build a base the closest that I can think of is that this is a tower defense. Unfortunately there's not a lot of variety in here after the 3rd time you went through it. It's a game that doesn't know whether it's an RTS, City Builder or a Tower Defense. Not excelling at either of the three.

A good example here is firing vision. You deal with 1000's (!) of enemies (like Supreme commander) at the same time, but your units sometimes shoot into a wall because a unit is obscured by it. Yet the AI is not capable of at least shooting at something else. So you will have sometimes a trebuchet shooting at one guy somewhere else, missing 100 shots (because they crash into a wall or stone) while an invasion is happening right next to it.

Either fix that, or let shots pass through terrain / walls. This added ""realism"" is not helping anyone.

The archer target distribution is also horrendous. The controlling aspect of the RTS side is just not good enough for a game that has you control THIS many units while fighting that many units.

The tech tree is also not giving you a lot of choice which would have been one option to diversify, but most choices are obvious.

A tower defense in which one mistake can destroy the last hour of progress unnecessarily. The reason why most Tower defenses are on pre set routes is to exactly avoid this and because it's easier to balance the difficulty ramp.

Something feels off about this difficulty ramp method, especially since the game keeps you artifically busy with you having to clear the map constantly while there's offmap waves coming as well all the time. You either resort to cheese or you accept that the game is incredibly opaque with what's happening and what's coming at you.

Also the controls are not good enough to excert the control the game implies in the trailers (with the phalanxes etc.). This also unfortunately includes the ECO side of the game. Instead of being able to define a specific limit that is auto exported we have to manually click and export resources. It does not add to tactical dept but keeps you from playing the game, like many other things unfortunately. Constantly recruiting but no Auto Build. Constantly balancing food and population.

Some maps are for most people only beatable if they know where what is so they can direct and time their resources there. It's an ok game but I'm feeling quite stressed after playing it which is something I really don't want in a game.

I tried loving it. But that's it.",1728501458,1728502458,False,5,1,0.563758373260498047,0,True,False,False

I liked building the walls of the city and thinking how i'd defend it but when the enemies came your archers just shoot through stuff and your footmen are just really good compared to the npc (this was the very begining so maybe later it's harder) plus the combat is kinda weird like I'd click my guys to fight but half of them would just stand around while the other half actually fought or they'd ignore the enemies and just attack a hut instead. 

Building the city was nice it looks nice and its really easy but it does lack in depth and there's no real point in building with any order and you can't place stuff right next to each other or the townfolk would get stuck in the building meaning your city takes up way more room than you think you need.

Why have a tech tree/research system? seems kinda pointless, instead just give me better stuff as I upgrade my keep, just seems like something they added because other games have it, doesn't add anything other than an annoying thing I have to check every 2 minutes which add kinda pointless upgrades.

The management aspect is really basic, your guys eat food you just gotta have enough each day kinda thing which you get by placing a fishing hut etc.. It's simple and not worth noting for the most part its just really basic.

I do think adding the power to shoot a laser from the sky or spawn some guys from hell is also a pointless thing and they're really op,.I do think this game could of focused on actually making good defences a more important thing rather than just lasing every enemy from orbit just seems like a kinda missed chance.

[b]Summary[/b]
This is a really great spiritual successor to They Are Billions. Where as I felt They Are Billions got worse in its early access journey, this game definitely got better and the 1.0 release has released an excellent game that has been worth the time.

[b]Gameplay Loop[/b]
The gameplay loop is pretty stable. You start with a main base and slowly expand your population by acquiring resources and expanding your economy. Each session will take you an hour or two to play (depending on how much you rely on pausing). Generally you take time to clear out segments of the map to claim for exploitation and then solidify your gains by figuring out ways to build defenses or station men. Intermittently large waves will attack you from an announced direction. 

The campaign does not do overly much to shake this loop up, but the loop is just pretty good on its own. 

[b]Campaign[/b]
The campaign is an improvement on just proc-gen endless modes, but I'd say with some significant missed opportunities. There are some side objectives that direct your attention or win condition in a slightly different direction, but you are still starting with the same base startup and applying the same gameplay loop with very little variation.

The campaign had some opportunities to shake up your starting conditions some more than it does, but it takes the path of just ramping the difficulty on the player assuming that the player is learning and getting better. This is fine, but it would have been more interesting to shake up the loop a bit.

[b]Story/Writing[/b]
I'll also call out that the story/writing in this game wants to be funny, but it landed pretty flat for me. While you can skip the whole dialogue scene, you can't accelerate the individual dialogues requiring you to listen to the whole thing if you are trying to pay attention. Overall, the dialogue overstays its welcome, it provides some loose context for ""why"" you are doing what you are doing - but it is not very well written. 

You also get to take the story down some branching paths, but this is really just gating content to encourage additional campaign playthroughs. I guess it is ok, but I personally would have preferred a more linear form of storytelling. 

You probably aren't playing this game for the gripping story though - so it is an acceptable weakness.

[b]Difficulty[/b]
This game is delightfully difficult. There are 5 difficulty levels available to make the game more accessible to players. The difficulty is also well designed in that it scales the volume and frequency of enemy assaults but doesn't touch health or damage points. This is a really nice way to do it and I found the 4th difficulty to be a good sweet spot for me to feel like I was being tested, but could push through and move the campaign forward. 

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Overall - really enjoying my time with this title. Highly recommend it if you enjoyed They Are Billions and are looking for a good reboot of that formula.",1728433492,1728433492,True,10,0,0.636254847049713135,0,True,False,False

However... the absolutely merciless ramp up of the difficulty in the campaign on the 4th mission is insane. I've learned a few things and started to progress a little bit farther but still haven't completed it, even after dropping the difficulty down to the lowest setting. I always get to a certain point where it just seems impossible to fend off the constant waves of enemies from the south while also dealing with the regular hordes of enemies that come less frequently and doing the objectives at the same time. I end up using all of my resources on the first things I mentioned and have nothing left to trade in at an insanely bad exchange rate for gold so that I can build the troops needed to put on the ships. I begin to run out of resources in safe areas and have to build work sites that inevitably get destroyed when the next large wave comes. The time in between waves seems like just enough to recover from the previous one, only to get rewarded with a fresh wave of enemies. I feel like this would be a whole lot better without the constant wave from the south. Then I could actually focus on the other mechanics. Please fix this or ease us into this difficulty better by teaching us more about the mechanics.

This is really my only complaint about the game, everything else has been pretty great. I would like to be good at this game but the learning curve is either very steep or it simply hasn't been play tested to make sure you can do it on all difficulties.

1- Every game is the same. No meta progression, early on I stumbled onto the best way to power up my economy and I can't find a valid reason to play differently.
2- Upgrades are bland, boring, uninteresting. I take the same ones every game, as they fall into 'mandatory' or 'useless' categories
3- Siege weapons is where the game turns into a beating. Your siege weapons take forever to take out towers, theirs are exceedingly hard to get to - and the only danger their army will ever present.
4- Bullet sponge (but that might just be a difficulty thing, could be an active decision) but with how clunky melee is you're relegated to mass backline. Which is okay, but forces a unit composition.
5- Unit cost. Again, this is for harder difficulties, but I can't bring myself to buy spearmen when axemen have better upgrades and are way cheaper to produce - even with their situational anti-cavalry status. Maybe it's a unit diversity issue too?

you can also build house for more ""builders"" which are required to actually build your buildings

1 level pacing: the levels in DiNaO can vary wildly in difficulty with some levels being especially difficult to complete even in the easist difficulty, some of the late levels feel outright impossible with basically everything needing to go your way in order to even have a shot of winning.

2 resource collection: resources in this game can be wildly inconsistent when it comes to their generation, because DiNaO has a constantly regenerating map (U will never play the same map) resource spawns can either make or break your campaign level. some games you get a good map with good cliff location, stone and iron deposites with a handful of infinte spawns within and easy and safe distance to gather. other times you find 90% of your stone and iorn sitting on the exterior side of cliffs making it incredibly difficult to secure starving you of resources and ruining your game.

3 Waves and enemies: this game in incredibly ruthless in how its enemies attack, some times you have ample and opportune times to focus on your economy, working on getting some progress done between enemy attacks, other levels most notably the first level u encounter crabs you simply have no time to actually build up or recover from attacks as the attack waves just blast through you too often to set up and effective defence and economy. once your behind you might as well restart as recovering is insanely difficult.

This is just my experience from just the campaign on the easiest difficultly, god forbid you try doing this on anything more difficult that hard.",1728347092,1728349841,False,2,0,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,False
176595656,76561198008476376,578,136,931,0,931,1728432687,english,"At first, I thought it was just another wave defence simulator, but it's actually a pretty decent RTS and, surprisingly, a ""mean"" city-building simulator. Everyone can find some fun in this game, and I got sucked into the campaign for the first 8 hours. The storyline is decent [i](especially for an RTS)[/i] and is spiced up with good humour. I also noted the good balance and moderate challenge [i](on the second difficulty level)[/i] for the player, where you’re not exactly on the edge, but you still need to click quickly. Everything was great until I reached a mission that many discuss in the forums, and suddenly, the game's flaws hit me all at once, burning me up:

Progress in the campaign resets at every level, and at least 30 minutes [i](and as missions progress, this time increases)[/i] are spent repetitively handling the city-building part, which gets tedious by the fifth time. You have to start all the research from scratch, which drags the game into a more routine and tedious experience, in my opinion. They could've easily avoided this by unlocking later buildings as you progress through the levels so that you could dive deeper into the more interesting aspects of the game rather than repeating everything from scratch each time.

After the waves of hordes, there's a huge lack of ""auto-rebuild"" for the destroyed buildings. Especially when the settlement grows, it becomes very difficult to track what was where. Considering that defending against hordes is one of the core mechanics, this often throws you off track.

Up until a certain mission, I didn't have any trouble completing the objectives and easily cleared the map. But then, everything fell apart all at once, and honestly, I don't want to start all over again, knowing that I'd have to rebuild the settlement from scratch every time.

I enjoyed the campaign, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it includes choices that add new mechanics and challenges, which interestingly change and enrich the gameplay. There's also a large selection of units to choose from, just what you need for a good RTS.

But man, from one mission to the next, it really started to bug me that you have to start over every time, just with slightly different starting conditions. When you're struggling with a game, you either want to overcome it and feel accomplished, expecting a reward and a sense of victory, or you think it’s just not worth it. After passing this level, I’m pretty sure the next one will force me to start from scratch again, which really spoils the game for me. People do share strategies on how to beat the notorious level by kiting the entire horde with a single unit [i](I did something similar on the previous level, feeding one unit to the boss at a time)[/i], but the game doesn't prepare you for this at all, and it’s no StarCraft by any means. Given the sometimes downright annoying city-building part, you're forced to sit and wait for the new day to come as there's a limit on actions [i](no new settlers)[/i], which gets exhausting. But at least there are time acceleration buttons, thank goodness.

My experience is based solely on [b]the campaign[/b], as it’s the fastest and easiest way to introduce players to the game.

For now, I’m giving it a thumbs down, but [b]just in pencil[/b], as I’ll try to beat the notorious level again. Still, I didn't expect this level of frustration—it feels like the game just wants to keep me stuck in it for as long as possible.

UPD:

Steam conveniently showed me how to actually beat the Ozzy level (via a live stream on the game's page), and I realized that my experience and speed were clearly not enough for that level. Maybe this level is specifically designed for RTS challengers? Like, ""Can you beat Ozzy?""... But I still managed to squeeze out diamonds through sheer frustration, got a few new gray hairs, and after several completely fresh attempts, I finally beat the level, and the game rewarded me with... the next level, which involved escorting a very slow unit with a limited number of troops. I lasted about 15 minutes before deciding that I'd had enough of the campaign.

UPD 2:

Okay, maybe I gave the game an undeserved thumbs down, considering that it can still be quite engaging.

It is fun spending time with the colony, expanding its population, make a thriving economy, set up defenses and go exploring. The problem is, the game doesnt allow you to enjoy those things. 

Even on the lowest difficulty level you will face rapidly increasingly powerful hordes until you die, no matter what. Unless you rush to finish your objective before that happen.  

It is very frustrating to play for a solid hour, just to find that the enemy has scaled up so much that the huge spike in difficulty decimates your whole colony without you being able to do anything about it.

It is like you really love ice cream, and while enjoying it someone puts a gun to your head and tell you to push it down your throat in ten seconds or die. Technically you ate an enjoyable ice cream, but like in this game the experience is ruined by the aggressive rushing mechanics.

Maybe some people like games with a countdown timer type of level design, but I really dont. I could beat the levels once I realized rushing is the key, but then I did not enjoy the game much.

Needs a game mode / level that doesnt scale the attacks so rapidly, so you can enjoy it without being rushed and frustrated. People who like a countdown timer type gameplay and pressure can of course just choose the higher difficulty levels.

I'm trying to find excuses for all of the CTD's and lack of QOL features, as well as just plain broken or missing things.

I cannot recommend this game at this time. It needs more time to cook, and it needs a dev who's more open to feedback. Multiple customers have commented that mission 4 has a huge difficulty spike and the dev responded saying get good. Thats extraordinarily offputting to me. A dev should want their customers to have fun and enjoy the game. I'm beyond the refund window so while I can't refund it, I can leave a review of my experiences.



The good:  

Its like Stronghold meets They are Billions. This should be great! But its held back by some serious flaws.

The bad: 

- Massed archers are useless. They all focus fire the same target which would seem fine, except arrows have travel time and units keep firing at the doomed target while lethal damage is already on route, so they enormously overkill the 1 peasant they attacked with 100+ arrows, and meanwhile there's 4,999 more peasants attacking that your archers ignored. The game needs some sort of spread fire or target random priority so archers don't waste nearly all of their shots uselessly attacking an enemy who's already dead.

- Your unit AI is abysmal, it will prioritize attacking buildings from creep camps over the siege engines defending the creep camps. It will also prioritize tough tanky enemies attacking your walls that don't do much damage instead of hitting the high damage but fragile siege engines throwing boulders at you. In contrast to your unit AI, the enemy unit AI is very good, it prioritizes attacking your squishy healers and archers with its artillery.

- I hope you like tedium! There's no auto-rebuild option which means you're manually rebuilding spike traps, one at a time, by the thousands. The maps are big and enemies come from all sides, so you need a lot of spike traps. Even if you have the economy to pay for replacements you're still manually placing them down. I've given up endless mode games because they're so tedious to constantly manually rebuild after every wave. Auto-rebuild doesn't mean rebuild for free, the player should be required to have the resources to rebuild the destroyed structure, just don't make them click and drag and paint huge swaths of the map after every wave. Its the pointless, tedious clicking for no good reason thats so upsetting. 

- You can only build 1 marketplace, so you can only trade 1 resource at a time, even though you may have many resources being produced in surplus for export.

- The game becomes increasingly unstable after early game. There's a lot of enemies on the screen but this seems to crash the game sometimes, which is a problem when its a horde tower defense game in the style of They Are Billions. Yes, I can reload from autosave, but playing knowing the game can crash at any moment is a bad feeling to have. I don't want to constantly have to worry about will my game crash.",1728290868,1728290868,False,30,0,0.732498705387115479,3,True,False,False

Some things to note for some balancing if a dev sees this: I may suck to the point I have to beat the campaign on ""walk in the park"", but in the beginning of the match, the waves are far too frequent for the amount of enemies that spawn in them, and the enemy bases are far too close in order to establish any sort of castle without them destroying a few buildings in the first day. Also, It may just be a skill issue, but my whole strategy has been hundreds of crossbowmen and the 30 troop soul knight regiment to clear anything on the map. This is just preference, but it seems like the only way to win any of the matches without going broke from training new troops everytime a clash happens.

Seriously. It's such a massive change in tactics and timings that MOST players will struggle enough to get angry... And that's on easy mode. 

While that is certainly their prerogative, it is hardly conducive to creating good will, nor encouraging.

So, I am adding my disapproval, in the form of an official complaint/review.

It reminds me of older ones from the 90s where difficulty is something that you had to overcome rather than it be handed to you. I read reviews like Alitari and those types of negative reviews are obvious of someone who played the first two levels and then came here to leave a snarky review talking about how they didn't like it because of things they never played long enough to find.

People such as Alitari and others are used to games that hand you the answers. This is a game where you learn to get good on each map and learn different ways to get good. I spent the entire day on a singular level until I finally learned the way to handle it. The game gives you enough tools to handle it, you just have to learn how to use it.

Is the game perfect? No but its better than a lot of AAA games that come out.

Give the game a shot and remember that this game is not a friendly ""I want to be handed things because I don't want to get good"". This game is like ""They are Billions"" where you find ways to survive and adapt and overcome.

Also, for me, unit balance was very important. During EA melee units were just a source of problems, spreading disease.

Now they actually make sense, because of how fast they regen, AND the attacking waves include archers, who prefer focusing units behind the walls, which makes archer spam less viable, or even better, forces you to have melee units to draw fire on them.

There are still a few units with limited to no use, like axeman, horseman and footknight (the alternatives are just better), but the game is already in a very good spot.

Content wise, campaign is story rich, however the cutscenes could use a button to skip to next animation. 
I also hope we get some extended research, more naval team, etc.

To me, they've always felt like trying to cook dinner while cleaning house and helping someone with homework at the same time while the pets are knocking things off tables. As you may imagine, this game has been kicking my ass.
Now, I'm going to recommend it anyway. Why? Because this is one of the very few RTS games that makes me WANT to try harder and get better at working in four places at once. The economy is the right level of complex, the buff buildings make a massive difference without being obnoxious to place, the fortifications are impactful and straightforward, the units on both sides have good variety, and the combat feels fantastic to control and observe.
There are obvious and apt comparisons to They Are Billions, but there are some major differences that need to be addressed. Most resource deposits eventually run out, population and food are consumed instead of being static ""capacity"" numbers, the scale of the map and your economy is much larger, and, most importantly to me, the game is actually balanced around losing units and buildings on a regular basis. A group of spearmen will handily hold a breach in the walls, often trading one of their lives for 30 or so rebels or just body blocking while the remaining archers continue shooting. Units are generally cheap and quick to train while still being much stronger than the horde units you'll be facing.

I still die much earlier than I should, but I can at least see the solutions to apply next time. Thankfully, it's not just ""click more, faster"" like too many RTS games feel.

As a new player, unfamiliar with the game, it was too much frustration to continue. The first level buildings are upgraded, two new resources are used, a whole host of new buildings come into play and your hit by a constant stream of enemies while trying build up to face the larger waves. 

Plus, in the forum a similar observation is raised and a dev leaves perhaps one of the most asinine remarks I've seen from a developer (to paraphrase) ""I completed the level on the hardest level and beat it first time"". Well woopie-di-do and lardy dar for you, bucko. A player takes the time to make a valid observation, expressing how there may be a hurdle to new players, and the dev blows them off with that BS attitude. Not everyone is in an indoctrinated acolyte of the Cult of Difficult and maybe, just maybe, the dev could take their observation and consider it as free product feedback rather than launch a ""git gud"" barrage. 

I like the game, genuinely has funny cut scenes, cute functional graphics, and a solid RTS, but it definitely needs better balancing on levels so far, and the devs attitude stinks if that was their response.

I struggle alot with the overview of the resources / management of vilagers. I have builders, but where are they? Has my fishery run out of fish? Apperantly so! What dictates how many workers I get each day? I can't get a grip of how the food demand/production equation works. There is a stats panel but I dont find any meaningful info there. 

Summary is that I feel like I have no idea what happens with the macro in this game. In AoE2 I have alot going on but I still know whats going on with my resources all the time. Maybe it's a combination of the visual style of the game and the hud that confuses me? It's very frustrating. The tutorial was imo way to short and did not explain enough of the systems. 

And it's way to rushy for me. The day timer is too short and the constant guessing where the enemy will come from is annoing. The micro becomes very cumbersome just opening gates, closing gates, putting archers in towers, taking them down from towers and send them to another tower.

Oh and the cutscenes between missions. It's nice that there is some semblance of a story. But dang, they are slow and uneventful to watch. Just found myself skipping all of them. They need to be sped up 10x

My issues lie exclusively with the combat/npc pathfinding so far as I am already having issues with their pathfinding causing them to get stuck and not be functionally useless until I can unstick them or destroy what they are stuck on. Controlling the combat troops isn't what I would want either as there doesn't seem to be any kind select all and the ability to create seperate groups was ignored in the tutorial. When commanding troops they can sometimes just choose not to move or if you select an enemy who dies they will stand there as if a whole group isn't behind them. I am optimistic about the game as the basis is enjoyable and most of my gripes are probably easily patchable but I was waiting for the 1.0 release specifically to avoid things like this, but I will probably give it more time soon and update if my opinion changes.

Update:I've played a bit more now and the issues above all still feel prevalent, I also have becoming irritated with the cutscenes which seem to assume the average player has the reading speed of a decomposing corpse and love extremely long gaps between everything, which ruins what would otherwise be decently amusing scenes. I'm probably gonna keep coming back to it as it gives me nostalgia about halo wars as a kid and their is a good game underneath these issues, but I still can't really recommend it to others YET (I'm choosing to be optimistic despite the games industry regularly proving that to be a dumb choice)

There are some factors which may give some people pause for thought where others will be pleased to see. Among these are:-

1. Maps are proceduraly generated - Although you'll start a map in the same location with the same rules the map will be different every time. This can cause a map to be easy on one play through and then mind meltingley hard on the next.

2. Not always clear how hard a map is going to be - Although there's 1 or 2 maps which are almost always an easy start, it's not immediately clear what you're walking into. This, however, may be down to me being a little dumb/menu blind.

3. The horde is real! You're not going to be going up against the massive numbers and diverse enemies you're seeing right away.

some lacking features that i hope they add (unsure if they plan to or not)
- an xp system for troops buffing their stats for the long game via kills (even perks that could be chosen!)
- different skins/civilisation themes for structures to add to the building variety once you have a large settlement going

besides those 2 things i think the game needs it is a beautiful masterpiece of large scale battles and city building that will only get better with future updates i hope!

It's mostly a 1 trick pony of ""do and build exactly this in exactly this order or fail"", so more of a puzzle game than a strategy game. And once you've solved the puzzle (or looked online), that's it. Just rinse and repeat.

It isn't a city builder by any stretch of the word. Building a city that is functional is somewhat low down on the list of things to do in this game. There aren't even roads. There's barely any building options either. Even the defences are hugely lacking, nowhere near as in depth or fun as something like Stronghold and waaaay more simplistic than something like The Settlers. There's no beautification options, no bridges, no material chains, nothing really. This is about as much city builder as C&C is, so it doesn't scratch the city builder itch.

It's not a tower defence game as it has all the simplistic ""city builder"" stuff slapped in there. There's also very few options for defences, just walls, towers and gates. There's watch towers which are simply there to negate the fog of war so you can cast spells. If it was like a normal tower defence game without all the strapped on crap, it might be fun. But it isn't, and it doesn't scratch that tower defence itch.

Combat is ""meh"", there's very little choice and ranged units seem to overpower most of the melee units. Just stick them in a tower and be done. And combat in general, when it isn't sticking guys in walls, is just a chore of micromanaging. It's also incredibly basic. There's a formation system (though again, very basic), which is nice, but then the 'hold' option on units is inconsistent. The only thing the hold button seems to do is stop melee units charging in face first, they 'hold' their position instead, often to their own detriment as they sit there watching the guy next to them getting murdered. It doesn't seem to affect ranged units at all, they just fire willy-nilly, causing chaos. So the combat doesn't scratch that combat strategy game itch either.

The most fun you can have is with spells, but to get the magic to cast the spells you have to go out fighting and destroying huts or finding ""magic veins"" and that's just... Well, see above.

Overall, it's boring and you won't be doing what is shown in the store images for the vast majority of your time. Yes you can get to that point eventually, but it's a massive boring slog to get to that point, and once there, it's all over too quickly, with very little substance to keep you engaged. 

TLDR: The beginning of the game should be like foreplay, exciting and engaging, making you want more, but it isn't. This game skips the foreplay and replaces it with house chores, then you finally get to the action and the game suffers from PE and it's all over, leaving you unsatisfied and frustrated.

Not worth the asking price, even on sale.",1723390875,1723390875,False,17,3,0.66720813512802124,0,True,False,True

Buy this game. It scratches a deep itch for gamers. Even the enjoyment I got out of the first 2 hours is worth the asking price.

This is pretty clearly inspired by Stronghold, the incredible RTS castle builder from 2001. That's not usually a good thing; Stronghold still runs well, plays well, and looks gorgeous, 23 years later. Few good competitors have come around because of just how incredible Stronghold actually is.

Diplomacy is Not an Option takes that as a compliment. It is on par with Stronghold. It is enjoyable through and through, offering a good challenge and progression tree.

What really amazes me is how the game focuses on the parts we care about. The layout of defenses is what matters most; resource management tends to be pretty easy.

Even if you only play for two hours, buy this game.",1722466630,1722649478,True,27,0,0.742852866649627686,0,True,False,True

TLDR - I am enjoying much more the game after last months of updates, but I would love to see more stuff that makes me care more about the village/city/tower to keep coming back or keep playing what I've built.

========================
I was not really enjoying the first versions. The ""big combat"" feature alone was not really something that could bring me back to the game. And that was true for a long time. What I missed (and I still miss) is the variation in the buildings or something in that sort... to make me care enough for the village, for the soldiers, etc... just spam soldiers and units is not really enough for me.
But after playing a lot more in the last week, giving more chances, trying to actually build something to care (even a good strategy, etc), my feeling got better with the game. The last updates were great, the attacks and the freedom that I can change my difficulty level are also great.

But I do think it still lacks a real reason to make me care enough - I can get the feeling I am trying to explain from a few games like Kingdoms and Castles, Farthest Frontier, They Are Billions and some others. And maybe this is not just the game for me, I know those games are different, but the lack of that feeling still exists here for me. So, a few suggestions to maybe make more interesting:

- Add maybe minor goals or events in each free map or endless maps;
- Add auto variations for the houses and other buildings: the terrain and vegetation are empty enough, but as soon as I build more stuff, it becomes even more bland;
- Add more stuff for the villagers, like decorations that matters to keep them in the village (not just simple decorations), or they might leave, or even stuff to make the battles more intense and make civilians react when a battle is won (I can't find this in any game) - just make the village more alive.

This is my opinion and I do understand that the game sold well and players like it, so maybe I'm just the one who wanted to see a bit more of it. Don't take this as a negative review, it is a good review, with some notes that I could see it becoming even better",1721081685,1721081685,True,6,0,0.581090211868286133,2,True,False,True

The campaign mode in Diplomacy is Not an Option is a solid entry point for players who enjoy strategic decision-making in tower defense gameplay. However, it has some notable drawbacks when it comes to replayability and story progression.
One key issue is the difficulty in exploring all the possible narrative choices. Once you choose a side—whether it's the Crown, the Rebels, or the Sarranga—you are locked into that storyline for the duration of the campaign. While this adds a sense of commitment to your decisions, it also makes it more cumbersome to experience the other sides of the story.
If you want to replay the campaign to see what the other factions offer, you're required to return to the load menu, which can be a bit of a hassle. The mission titles are not always easy to remember, and finding the right point in the campaign can be tedious. As of now, the only viable way to fully experience all of the branching narratives (Rebel, Crown, Sarranga) is by creating a new profile and replaying the entire campaign from scratch. This limitation detracts from the game's overall flexibility and could discourage players from exploring all the narrative paths.
On the positive side, the campaign is engaging, with interesting faction choices and varied challenges that keep things fresh. But a more streamlined method for switching between storylines, or at least a clearer mission tracking system, would greatly enhance the replayability of the game.

Additionally, I wish the developers would introduce more of the unique enemy troops from the campaign—like the bosses and even the crabs—into the endless and sandbox modes. These enemies bring variety and added challenge to the campaign, and having them in other modes would make the game feel richer and more diverse in terms of threats.

Another area for improvement is housing space. The current system for building housing in the campaign is frustratingly inefficient, as housing structures take up a lot of the map’s space. It feels like a constant battle to find enough room for your buildings, especially when space is already limited. Hunger also adds another layer of difficulty, 8 frickingh lvl 2 with a lot of berry isn't enough to feed my peasants.

lastly,  Acquire gold in the game is really hard or am i just stupid that there is menu that i can open or something ohh well... . It often feels like you're scraping by, and I found myself constantly wishing for a better way to earn it. I think an in-game taxation system would be a fantastic addition, allowing players to tax their citizens to generate additional gold. This would add a layer of depth to managing your economy and make it feel like you're governing a real kingdom with economic decisions to make.

but all in all game is great hardcore difficulty is winnable while nightmare is bs",1719816383,1728567928,True,1,0,0.488912880420684814,0,True,False,True

The good:

At release balance was an issue for some players but the devs have been working on it and balance has improved. DNO is actually pretty fun with it's cross between RTS and tower defense. Along with the stylized graphics and humorous storyline DNO makes for a fun and unique experience.

The game pushes you to expand quickly unlike many other RTSs that punish for expanding too quickly. You'll get the hang of it and I actually quite enjoy this way of playing.

There are about a dozen maps to choose from for endless mode each balanced with higher or lower difficulty and different factions to fight against each with unique units. The undead are quite fun to play against.

There five different difficulty levels to play in the campaign mode. The higher levels are quite challenging.

DNO also has different paths to choose from with four different endings. So there is quite a bit of  replay ability in the campaign.

The good good:

The devs are active on Steam forums, Reddit and very active on Discord. The devs are on top of feedback and bug reports.You couldn't ask for more active developers.

The bad:

But DNO  does have it issues in the QoL department. The most glaring lack of a feature is that you are limited to just 5 auto saves, total, across all game modes. Not 5 saves per map, but 5 saves total! There is also no means to rename or even organize your saves. You also cannot rename or organize saves. Everything is limited to 5 saves. THough this can be circumvented with creating multiple in game accounts for campaign and endless modes it is still a hassle.

What this means is that when you want to play a new map or hop between games modes the autosaves for any previous games will be overwritten and you will lose all progress from previous maps that you have played. This also means that you cannot hop between campaign and endless modes because all previous progress in your campaign progress will be overwritten...

There are other issues such as when building different military units there is no information providing their stats before building them. Only after you have built them will you be able to see their different stats. Damage, attack speed, attack range, speed, melee and ranged damages, etc.

These features should have been a no-brainier. Literally countless games over the decades of PC gaming have had these features. The devs haphazardly dropped the ball on not implementing these features.",1716239162,1729988206,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From a veteran of RTS game, the game has pause/play/speed-up game speed elements that allow players to catch up on their economy and base building delegations.  It's centered around base defence PVE style where you defeat waves of a few factioned hordes.  Microing units isn't as focused as much compared to base placements and planning your progression towards higher tiers of the game.  The unit AI is simple and the command menu can change attack priorities which gives the option to the player in how they want to eliminate opposing units.  There are different game modes that tweak the goals and objectives of the game which is really good for players who want to experience the game with altered starting/ending resources and objectives.

For casual players who have no prior experience to how RTS games should be played, the game can improve on the tutorials because, in the normal and campaign mode settings, players might not be able to unlock further tiers of technology or even survive long enough in the game, if those new players don't know what to prioritize in the game.  

Aside from what was mentioned, overall solid defence RTS game.  It'll definitely deliver on the defensive tactic many commanding officers are looking for. ^^",1704007513,1704007513,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is a straightforward game that can be easy but has a high skill ceiling. It has a sandbox mode and will have a campaign. If you are a new player to the genre, you can stop reading here.


For genre veterans; If you came here from They Are Billions or any similar city builder/tower defender looking for more, I am sad to inform you it doesn't do what TAB does better in any way. Again, I only brushed the surface, but the combat doesn't work as well, the maps aren't as large, and the concept isn't as interesting. The tech tree is very straight forward, there are limited enemy types, and even the method of expansion on the map is less interesting. There's less to do overall in almost every category.

First off, I enjoyed it for at least 35 hours (some levels can be pretty long but you can easily come back to them later). This satisfies the minimum $1-1 hour ratio, and I haven't even 100% completed all of the challenges. Second, it is essentially a series of sandbox and endless maps (for now), but I am looking forward to the potential of this game. I had 100% completed TAB (They are Billions, a hardcore RTS game), and both games have the same general concept (with random map & enemy horde generation, waves, city-building, etc.). Moreover, I think the medieval route with magic (which definitely should be expanded, with magic units perhaps) and the infection mechanics are great. Third, the point of this game is a challenge yourself by building vast armies and/or defenses to combat massive waves of enemies (do not underestimate your enemies!), so it is more of a fast-paced massive RTS (with a pause button and save mechanics, of course). There is already plenty to do, and the devs are pretty clear and transparent in their updates (which is a great sign).

It feels like a spiritual successor to the Stronghold series, as you work to build walls, traps, and a variety of tiny little warriors to defend your ever-expanding economy. Having to feed your troops as well as your citizens makes economic management a careful balancing act, as building too big of an army will create a deadly famine, while focusing too much of your economy will place it in danger of the ever-expanding waves of attackers.

The real strength of the game, though, is the graphics. I've seen plenty of games attempt a low-poly style and end up feeling soulless and generic. This one does the opposite - it oozes character and charm. The characters, buildings, and warriors all have beautifully detailed animations, and you can happily spend a good while watching your little smiths tinker away in their forges, your lumberjacks haul logs back from the forest, or a squad of spearmen face off against a horde of peasants.

The choice of enemies is similarly delightful. Huge, teeming waves of low-HP attackers make for delightfully satisfying fights, made even better by the physics-enabled impacts that throw them into the air. Even losing the game becomes a visually satisfying experience, as you watch the enemy pour into your base. And somehow, it still runs as smooth as butter - I didn't get any FPS drop even when the waves became colossal.

No? just me?.....  Aaaaanyway, it seems to me that the devs are going for something like that, and did pretty good at it too, so far. It's quite similar to the games i mentioned earlier but without the clutter and micromanaging of having to balance several diferent factions, tech trees and the like. There's still some of that, enought to make a difference but not that time consuming or annoying. There's also several attacking factions with different aspects to them to keep in mind when defending, etc.

All in all, an excellent primary gamplay loop with a lot of versatility but without much depth, and cathartic action that even at its most complacent moments manages to keep you engaged and on your toes. The only real con is that there's not that much variety in general and a few qualities of life improvement can be seen missing here and there, but hey, that's what early access is for. Bottom line: having a lot of fun with it and looking foward to see what the devs cook up for the next update.

The only thing slower than the campaign are the cutscenes! It's like someone soaked the comedic timing in molasses!

Besides that it's been quite enjoyable and challenging. Just finished the third mission of the campaign after not playing for at least a year and it has been a good ramp up in difficulty throughout. I could see my self failing that 3rd mission if I didn't basically know what I was doing before hand. The extra mission objectives are a serious plus. Looking forward to the rest of the campaign. 

RECOMMENDED
Don't be surprised if you have to restart a mission or two if you've never played before.

If the Diplomacy.. is already enjoyable to play as is however the campaign is only at 10% of its development progress. So most people enjoy the game as is are the people who like to play in the free sandox mode and decide of their own challenge, I am not that kind of person I prefer a campaign.

The final release is set for November 2023 but so far the campaign has only 2 missions. For some reason the 2nd and last level available was a massive increase in difficulty on the economic side of things and I wish there was more guidance like a few tips to help me orienting my strategy. I see in that a good and a bad sign, the good: the game is more complex than just having to use the correct unit. The bad: I am fine banging my head on the wall and take the time to find the solution but I know a lot of players who are way healthier than me and would stop playing instead, quick tips or even a small video to guide us to beat the mission would be nice.

I definitely like it but then it immediately reminds me of Alien Marauder which for some reason went under the radar of the steam community if you like it here go check Alien Marauder. EA lacks consistency in content update but the game is good without being exceptionnal. I wish they could add a multiplayer mode.

PROS:
1) Zoom in and out levels are great - high overview and then detail up close is pretty nice. I don't feel restricted in the camera zoom or rotation.

2) Troop formation control is good - simple and intuitive: Mouse drag to set direction while simultaneously using keyboard to select arrangement of your formation, which is basically various sizes of line, block and column. Select guard mode so that your swordsmen stay disciplined in the line to guard your archers. Swordsmen will do their job when enemies get close enough. Developers might want to consider tactical pre-sets for formations too, like hollow square and wedge formations for example.

3) Economy buildings are diverse and interesting, keeping the interplay of resources an important aspect of the game.

4) Tech tree is nice - graphic style is creative. Military units, medical, worker speed, trade, etc. are upgrade choices that you make.

5) Obelisk powers add a nice fantasy aspect to the game - nothing like hitting that mob of ghouls with a meteor!

6) You can have a lot of units and enemies on the battlefield at once.

7) You can choose to build your town and castle walls the way you want.

CONS - as of the current Beta version:

1) Attacks come on a timer, and the problem is that sometimes it takes quite awhile to defeat the current wave of attackers. Meanwhile the clock is still ticking and the next wave is on top of you before you have time to repair, rebuild and create more troops. This is frustrating especially if you have just finished an epic defense of your town. The amount of time invested in building up vs. the speedy overwhelming defeat seems unbalanced and not as much fun as if you could eke out the survival of your town and live to fight another day. A simple fix would be to have the timer start after the current battle is over. Or perhaps another possible fix would be to award gems for an epic defense, to use the obelisk powers to defend against the next wave, while you rebuild - so still keeping it challenging, but possible to pull out a win from that next immediate wave.",1691604651,1691604651,True,25,0,0.756301522254943848,0,True,False,True

Yeah sure, its missing some content, such as more weapons/troops or more defence buildings or traps. 
Economy and productions is pretty basic and only 5 resources. 
Attack waves can be huge!! thousands of enemys storming your defence is really fun! Overall a nice littel game, but also some way to go! Buy on sale!

There is a but! Im really not so happy about difficulty settings. The game is pretty difficult, at least for me.
In endless game, the difficulty settings are worthless, after the jump between, boring as hell and not managabel is pretty fast. PLEASE add some option, between a wave every 7 days and the next option (only 4 days ) should be at least one more option!

+nice castle building with towers and catapults etc.

It has some changes to the formula that I can appreciate, though it should be kept in mind that I have relatively little time in this game and I haven't actually completed a map yet.

The economics are a little more detailed, with workers having to physically travel the map and transport their products to storage buildings. It's an extra layer of management with a game style that already constantly demands your attention in different places, but from what I can tell it's a manageable change considering the game seems to me to be less punishing than TABs. 

I do appreciate the added physicality in this game, with line-of-sight concerns and an emphasis melee combat and units to hold the line. The emphasis on setting your units up in formations as opposed to the old-school Blob-of-Death you'll find in TABs. I'm just a sucker for a good battle line. Also, to my limited understanding your army variety and the overall balance between your units seems to be greater in this than in TABs, so I can appreciate that!

Having to bury your dead is a fascinating change, if a hair frustrating. Though I haven't encountered the mechanic enough to see how it pans out when the brown-stuff hits the whirly-thing.

I will say that flavor-wise the game (currently?) lacks slightly for me. The visuals are clean, functional and cute. The premise and enemy are solid and novel to me. Music wise, though, I'll say that it's one of the few games that I'll mute it and put on my own music and vibe. It's functional, and I do like the main menu theme, but so far I haven't encountered anything that felt like it really elevated my experience. This is a point where I keep making unfair comparisons to TABs, because the music in that game is PHENOMENAL, especially the songs that come on during the different waves. It just does so much to enhance the mood of the gameplay in a way that DINAO lacks. Maybe this is an aspect that will get some love more towards release, I can't say.

Overall, I dig it. I haven't played many of the other survival strategy options out there, so I can't say whether or not you should buy DINAO over the others, but I've been coming back to the game here and there since I've bought it at the beginning of Early Access.",1689566439,1689566439,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Personal feedback:
One thing I think could be very helpful is a tech queue and maybe have the tech button flash when you finish research, I also think maybe having troops level up could be a cool idea but I think that would be better left to a mod if this game ever gets workshop support. I also think having walkways would be nice, as normally in these games they allow people to walk faster along them, and it would also help greatly in visualizing where you might want buildings in the future. In the same vein maybe having a sticker feature like in Civilization 6 so you can give the map a once over and decide what things you want where, place all the markers for things on the ground, and go back to it later once you can actually build it, would be pretty cool.",1688593082,1688593082,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Multiplayer Ideas: 

1- Castle Wars: Build your castle and produce your units with a given amount of resources. It can be a custom match. Let's say 10 rounds. Each round resources will go up. As a win bonus, you will receive additional resources. (Not much) if you win 6 games, you are the winner. This can be played with 2 players, as well as up to 4. Preparation time: 3 mins, and each round additional seconds or minutes. 

2- Co-op Challenges. It's self-explanatory. 

We are multiplayer-lovers. But I like this game especially, even though it's single-player.

very much a  tower defense city management feel.

the only thing i dont like is the lack of proactive/offensive options. that being said, its tower defense so ur not supposed to be able to curtail the offensive...but imho this game feels like it should have it. or at least offer a game mode with such. would really like to be able to take the fight to my opponent instead of holding out as long as possible. regardless this game is fun, the UI is good and the gfx are legit. something very rewarding about lazing a horde just as they are about to overwhelm ur troops/walls.

devs if ur reading this id love to see a game mode where the assaults dont start until u ""clear"" the map of the local hostiles. would be cool to be able to build up first before the wave assaults begin. i know theres modes where the assaults are slower/take more days to initiate, but as a noob (and a perfectionist) its still too fast for my taste. coupling that with the need to expand as u progress makes it hard to lay out effective walls beforehand. just my 2 cents. OH! an alternate method for earning crystals (or whatever the unit is that allows the godlike abilities) would be very welcome. i appreciate the challenge of the limited amount, but would be cool to not contend with that too. maybe require worship or something time based which requires workers but is otherwise renewable/sustainable.

anyway, this is a fun tower defense city manager RTS. i give it a good ol recommend, i can see this being a main-stay for me, especially if the devs keep adding to it.

So...

Given that I have played this game for >800 hours to date (omg, how do I do facepalm emoji?), my review will hopefully be of some use to someone!

Firstly, I love this game! The design, the humour, game play, most aspects in fact make this one of the most fun RTS I have possibly ever played...it's brilliant..

BUT... The one (and I truly think this is the only one) FATAL downfall that drives me insane about this game is the difficulty system.. It seems to me (a casual gamer of limited talent I am sure), that the easy mode is just too easy, but anything beyond that is just too difficult, and then the challenging modes are utterly pointless/total waste of time.

It is immeasurably frustrating to constantly lose at the same time within every game regardless of the strategy you try to employ, the resources & time available to recoup from successive waves of attack are diminished so much that it is impossible to succeed beyond a set time frame, it is a zero sum situation that leaves you utterly downtrodden.

I don't need a game to give me impossible odds, that is what life is for! I want something that gives me a consistent fighting chance so I can escape into an entertaining world where I get to overcome the odds! Isn't that why we have entertainment?

Please fix the difficulty system, or provide options to adjust the odds, and this is an absolute gem for the ages...right now it has become utterly disheartening...

UPDATE: Difficulty system is still a joke.... :(",1682608455,1730842995,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Usually i like the realistic gritty ones.  But I really like the brighter graphics on this one.

I also think the game play is better, with more varied/fun units.

But here is what i REALLY like about this one over those:

In those games, it's really hard to expand, and space itself is a valuable resource.  It's a good mechanic, really.  

But it means you essentially have to just blob down structures and cannot build fortifications in a magnificent fashion.

Not so here.  Here, you can build a huge, open fantastic fortification-or system of fortifications.  

You still better be careful expanding.  And maybe some won't like that you don't have the added challenge of tight quarters.   But I really like it.

Anyway, this is just a fun, easy to get into RTS/defender with fun graphics, reasonable system requirements(now) and a lot of freedom.

So, my game time would be higher but I kinda get turned off of it when this happens. I've still yet to work out exactly what about it causes the issue. But what I can say about my play time and how much I've enjoyed it? The game is a good RTS, but bare bones. There is a lot they could do with this but haven't chosen to act on yet or create. With the announcement of a second title before even completing their first one; there is a lot of disdain for game as of late and it shows in other reviews. How much more content would we get for this game if the Door 407 actually focused on it to completion of every last detail of not only what they set out to do but what they could do beyond just their published roadmap? What does all of this have to do with the game? Well it is quite apparent that they're not focusing on the game's development as much anymore when the updates were every couple of months last year to non-existent in 2023. December, October, August, June, May... all ""major"" updates last year, with some hotfixes between each of them as well. But It's April and the release of their new title is approaching fast. Once you get passed the first few levels of the game it gets rather repetitive and there isn't any new wrinkles down the pipe from the enemies to spice things up. On top of that the maps get very old, very quickly, especially with how small they are. And this is coming from someone who actually wants to enjoy playing the game for a long time and see it grow and prosper. I don't hate this game, but when I've got only so much funds and the potential for other similar titles to be just as good and if not more engaging. Why would anyone honestly recommend wasting $25 USD on this? Go get Company of Heroes 2 or go old school and pick up a Commander & Conquer title. It's really easy to see why the RTS genre has died through the years to micro-transaction infested mobile games when so many studios can't do it justice.

Door 407, I want to enjoy your game and what you envisioned. I really do. But until you actually step up to the plate and sink some home runs in several updates I have yet to see why anyone would continue to trust you. I can't provide feedback when you're not even showing us you're on the track to begin with anymore. I don't see what makes this product worth $25, and I don't see you trying to make it worth even more than that this year. You started out decent, where are you now?

Edit: Over the past week or so they've teased and now released, as of May 17 2023, the spring update. Quite frankly, the update so far has been one of those home runs I was hoping for. Now, I don't want to jump to being immediately critical or going for the negative because that's like kicking someone back down when they're trying to get up again. So, to keep it simple and encouraging for the devs, yet accurate for the people watching whether or not to buy this game. Door 407, you've done good here just don't let this be it. This is a good start for the year, breaking the silence to really come through with a few new defenses, new abilities, more controls for game modes and so on, this has been well done. Just keep it going. I didn't say all I had to say before just because you were silent in 2023 till now. You did good, but keep going. Your community hasn't forgotten that you've announced a second game well before even finishing your first. Especially when there is so much potential here. As for the consumer watching this game's progress, well if the game is on sale for half off, go for it. It is your choice, at time of updating this the game is $20, or $5 off. It is a waiting and see game at this point with Urbo, Door 407's second game, with Urbo's release being Q3 2023 we'll just have to watch and see what happens for content for Dinao.

This RTS game with Tower Defense elements is not going in the right direction. It does not have all aspects that is necessary for an RTS game. There are lots of things which they should have prioritized, but instead they prioritized on other things which will have negligible impact on the fun factor of the game.

The unit type is very limited. They should have focused on adding more playable unit types. But they didn't.

Lack of terrain variation. Even though they said the map is randomly generated, but you can't really tell, because they all look 95% similar. They should have created more variation of terrain textures. But they didn't.

Resource distribution is quite terrible an uneven at some times. At some point, you'll get several iron ores very close to your main base. And at other points, they are very far away, so your main base is open for tons of unexpected attacks from fast-moving enemies. Hence you'll get crushed easily. Fyi, iron ores are the critical resources for your entire colony to advance. Without it, then it's practically game over soon.

There's are 3 types of game mode: Endless mode, Scenarios, and Campaign. The campaign mode is just dull. Even with the added cartoon, it does not add value to the game. The endless mode is the most interesting part of the game. But sadly, they created unbalanced difficulty level. The lower level is very easy to beat. Once you're able to create a stone wall, then you're practically invincible, because they enemy waves do not have enough attack power to bring down even 1 tile of wall. On the other hand, the higher level is very hard to beat. The enemy waves will come with many powerful units, fast-moving units, and even artillery. They can easily beat your main army in open combat and easily destroy multiple tiles of wall or towers. So it's game over once your entire army is crushed. No chance to rebuild. It's the most stupid mechanics to happen in an RTS game, because the most fun aspect of an RTS game is if players always have the opportunity to always rebuild and always keep up with the incoming enemy force. In addition, with very limited playable units in Endless mode, makes this game very boring after 1 or 2 trial.

The scenario mode is also not really fun and not worth replaying. It's very predictable and basically you just need to implement one style of strategy to win it. No point in trying to replay scenario, because it is not design for strategy. It is designed for you to memorize your steps in winning it. So this is another stupid implementation of the game with an RTS aspect to it. Oddly there are a lot of enemy unit types available in scenario mode, which should have been available in the endless mode.

There's also no tool for mods or community-made maps. This reality makes the game much worse than They are Billions.

Despite all of the negative aspects and feedbacks from players, they decided to be stubborn and still continue with their idea to create a cartoon instead, which will not be memorable. They are spending too much effort on creating a story with cartoons which nobody will even care about in the end. It's an RTS game, so why do they focus on a cartoon story? Are they trying to change the game's genre and become something like ""The Last of Us"" game? They are Billions don't even have any cartoon story, but they manage to acquire a huge number of players and high positive reviews.

But I guess some developers just love to maintain their ego instead of selling the game to players.",1679933319,1679933319,False,4,1,0.532235920429229736,0,True,False,True

134709799,76561198009308011,0,27,1476,0,350,1679588472,english,"So... Diplomacy. It ain't an option, but what is this game, exactly? More or less, this is Age of Darkness : Final Stand with a more cartoony art style, and a development team not crewed by morons that don't know their gluteus maximum from a hole in the dirt. Obviously, this game has taken some pointers from They Are Billions, a game that showed Activision was WRONG when they declared RTS games dead as a genre, but they don't copy it word for word like AoD did. Instead, they expand upon it! There's a lot to appreciate here with quality of life changes and good design decisions. 

To start, one flaw TAB had was with its camera system. When designing towns, it was difficult to manage the entryway of buildings, especially houses, in such a way that you could make neat, orderly lines that were as efficient as possible. Diplo has a full 3D camera that can view the game from any angle you please, even getting those top-down views that allow for picture perfect placement. Nice. :)

Another problem TAB and AoD has was maintenance. Everything costed a maintenance fee, which really made me scratch my head. Was there not a zombie apocalypse going on? Their payment should be a day's meal, and getting to live another day without getting turned into a brain eater. Diplo took this to heart and soldiers only cost the food required to keep them from starving to death (it can happen), and the raw materials required to create their gear, which is a nice change of pace. Much like humanity in its adolescent, medieval times, you're going to be spending most of your time focusing on creating enough food for everyone, and then raw materials like stone, iron, and wood to keep the malcontents from burning your throne room to the ground. The gameplay loop of resource collection, logistics, construction, expansion, clearing, and wave defense is really quite satisfying. 

A word on defense. At first glance, its very simple. You have walls, towers, and archers to shoot down from them. Even TAB had tesla towers, ballistas, and gatling guns... but FEAR NOT, dear basement dweller, Diplo has you covered. Towers can stock about 9 archers/crossbowmen at a time, giving them a nice little range boost, but they can also have catapults, and ballistae loaded instead. This gives some nice, tactical options for how you want your defense to be laid out. Oh, and your archers can also stand on walls, which is something I haven't seen since Battle for Middle Earth 1 back during the halcyon days when EA used the Sage engine! 

Even though it's still in early access, there's more than enough content here to satisfy even the nit-pickiest of internet denizens (though there are still many who engage in what I call “unemployed behavior”, and you can't appease someone with THAT much free time). The developers are just blazing through their development schedule too, and have released FIVE major updates, based on community feedback, in the single year Diplo has been in early access. These guys have their thumb on the pulse of the community and know precisely what they're doing. The price tag isn't overly extreme for what you get either, but wait for a steam sale if you must.

The single-player campaign is well-designed, providing a challenging and rewarding experience. The multiplayer mode is also a great addition, allowing players to test their skills against others online. The battles are intense and fast-paced, requiring quick thinking and strategic planning.

This is a simplified version  of the medieval warfare game of castles and catapults.  I like this one because of the ""chill"" factor.   The designers didn't take themselves too seriously.  They made a game where you could get a basic economy and have basic troops with some degree of difference in performance.

By taking the path of least resistance, they gave us a game that has fun and strategy but goes easy on the learning curve and brain burn.  There may still be bits of that if you ramp up the level of difficulty but it is entirely possible to learn the game quickly and have fun at the lesser levels.  

Graphics are not a strong point but they aren't poor either.  You can clearly make out the buildings as well as the flora and fauna.  It does not strive for strict realism but there are doses of that.  Dead bodies left littering your home area cause people to get unhappy and even ill.  Economics rears its ugly head to bring life in the game closer to reality but once you learn what to build and when, the game can be forgiving of little mistakes.

Politics are ignored and I for one am pleased they are.  Health issues are left at a basic level but not too basic.  You must consider you populace while you are waging war.  This can be a fun ""tower defense"" game or ramped up to be a serfdom mini-simulator.   Some thought and good choices were put into the design which made it easier to enjoy this game.

Pros:
+Intuitive gameplay
+Readable UI
+Multiple playable modes outside of campaign
+Minimal bugs
+Can be very difficult if you choose

Cons:
-Main game massively unfinished
-Extremely slow updates and development
-Expensive(This shit should be free)

Conclusion:
The game is lovely. Perfect gameplay loop, no bugs, beautiful art style and graphics, but there is maybe ~2hrs of gameplay for a $28 game if you only want to play the campaign. The game lacks so much content that it cannot justify its price tag even with the steam winter sale on. In a stage of development where user feedback and player interest is so important, why is this game locked behind such a hefty price tag? This game needs to be free, otherwise not worth it in its current state.",1672542801,1672542801,True,0,0,0.418347090482711792,0,True,False,True

As of this writing (12/26/2022) you get the following:
- 3 difficulty levels
- 2 campaign levels, one of which gives you a choice of which enemies to fight
- 5 or 6 challenge levels, each with 3-4 changes on the challenge

The gameplay is a great little RTS that has your fairly durable forces fighting against literally tens of thousands of enemies on some of the longer maps; however, those durable forces can easily be overwhelmed by the hordes that come at you.  Tier for tier, unit for unit, you have a more powerful army, but you'll need it to compensate for their numbers.

My only complaint so far is that it's not out yet!

You will probably like this if you:
- Like playing RTS games
- Like playing defense against hordes of enemies
- Enjoy games like They are Billions or playing custom games in Age of Empires, Starcraft, or Supreme Commander where you're holding out against an overwhelming force

Resources a joke, everything requires wood, yet wood cannot be replanted, leading to you being forced to expand to keep up with demand, which then leads to more food demand, which leads to more food sources, which leads to more wood. In order to keep up with his crazy cycle of wood demand you have to expand and make you base bigger, but as you make it bigger you need to make more and more walls just to secure weakness, yet there are hardly any choke points in a tower defense game, so expect to expand in a 360 map just to get stone, iron, and wood which are FINITE early game. Honestly the worst economic tower defense game I've played which punishes you for expanding, yet you NEED to if you get bad mountains, stone, or metal.

This game forces perfection on any difficulty just to keep pace with the waves of enemies. By far it is the least relaxing tower defense game on the market, go play any other, at least you'll enjoy your time instead of hitting the reset button after an hour of failure again and again.

Edit 8/13/24: Played the game again after years. I don't think a single thing has changed. Trash difficulty curve, RNG, limited resources, literally nothing has changed. I don't even see new units, maps, or anything except the sandbox mode. The sandbox mode kind of sucks to, making your options so limited. I'd like to actually see the devs play their own game without cheating in crap or you know, surviving past wave 4.",1671873993,1723599720,False,9,0,0.518177628517150879,0,True,False,True

It is really hard/possible to recover after a massive first wave in just 4 days, and then the second massive wave comes and you completely get wiped out! I barely have any time to build up an army let alone build up resources and buildings. On top of that there are also massive hordes of enemies way more powerful then you all over the map, blocking you from getting the resources you need to grow! So while your building your army up for an attack you also have to use that small army to attack enemies in your way further weakening yourself so you can get crushed by the next wave!!!! I like playing it but so far it feels massively unbalanced against you and I wish I could get to a lvl 3 town hall lol. So far I have not made it. I understand it shouldn't be super easy but right now it feels impossible to win on some missions. If there was a way to get resources faster or get your population to grow almost instantly when you build more buildings, rather then waiting days for results? Or lowering the amount of enemies around on the maps so your units don't get so destroyed? Or after you defeat a wave of enemies you get a bonus amount of resources after to help you recover slightly? I don't know, I think they have a great game and its a lot of fun to play, I am just feeling like I am missing something in order for me to experience more of the features the game has to offer. I have barely been able to make it to Town Hall II and have spent all my resources doing so. It doesn't even seem like there are enough resources on the map to get you past Town Hall II some times.  I hope this gets seen and can be further balanced  and or tweaked. They look like they spent a lot of time on the buildings, units, terrain, building materials, and enemy units! Really like this game and think it can go even further where the player isn't so beet up from having to multitask so much they miss out on things and can make it to the final wave more prepared.

There's a good few hours of entertainment in it for sure but it kinda feels like they just want to drag you along till you have passed the refund time. 

Like another review states, it also bothers me how they are scummy enough to show you all the intended campaign mission from the start, but 3 missions in you discover that they haven't moved on since then. 

On top of that, they add these game usual game modes like last stand and so on, which if you ask me are meant for when the campaign is over and you want some extra entertainment. Instead they kinda focus on it, I bought this game months ago and not a word has been spoken about the campaign. 

As an extra topping on the lack of Sundae, they even have the audacity to go ""Diplomacy is not an option, We need this award!"" for the Steam awards... Game is decent but this is not a company I will ever back again.

You gather resources, kick start your production, and hire builders and soldiers to do gruntwork. The gimmick is that your enemy doesn’t have a base of operation. Instead, they attack you in waves from outside the map boundaries, at set intervals. Sort of like in a tower defense game. You know where they come from too, giving you some space to focus your defenses. And as a last push in their final attack, they also gather up stray units from encampments around the map -- giving you some mitigating busywork to do between the earlier waves.

It’s fine. But I think I might have raised my hopes up a little too high. The marketing material makes it seem like this epic tower defense game, where you defend your bastion from closing armies. A real focus on scale and excess. Huge crescendos. Massive armies. Yet, the game starts out with such humble beginnings. Small armies defending tiny castles, with barely enough resources and units to go around. It’s both slow and punishing, never really reaching those epic proportions. It sort of just fizzles, somewhat unceremoniously.

WOW! These devs know how to make a game great. Nearly everything I posted below has been fixed, added, and improved upon. Great job!

The Good: 
--Fun and challenging gameplay. Units are varied and fun to use. Spells are a blast to use. Decent amount of varied and fun scenarios to play in Endless and Challenge modes.

The Bad:
--Campaign isn't finished with only 3 levels available. No editor for scenarios, endless modes, etc.

Thu Ugly: 
--Crashes at least 1-3 times a play session (2-3 hrs) if not more

Needs:
--Map editor and scenario creator
--A way to queue up research if materials are available
--Better route AI for workers or allow them to go through walls
--A way to see the crystals and carts within the trees better would be good or just auto-pickup if relatively close.

This will likely be a fun game, and I think it was worth the money for me, but wait on it until things are communicated clearly and the price makes sense for the available content.

+Humorous campaign cut scenes
+Diverse enemy types
+Content that has been released is highly polished
+Significant depth in city and defense planning
+High Quality voice acting 
+Multiple game modes to keep you engaged

Cons: 
-Game is not finished yet
-Not a significant need to use melee troops when towers and archers are easier to keep alive
-Updates come out slowly
-Only 2 playable missions in campaign
-Lack of variety to units in each enemy type
-No research queue
 
Personal Opinion:
Diplomacy is Not an Option (DNO) offers thrilling real time strategy that also happens to be a tower defense and city management game. The more I learn about the game the more I want to play. It can be easy to overlook the complexity and depth of city and defense layout, but it all starts by realizing how building storage next to production increases the rate of materials harvested, and how water fountains increase the population of nearby houses, or how builder houses need to be dispersed throughout the city in order to reduce the time it takes a builder to get to a construction site, and so on. There are quite a few different enemy types like undead, peasants, royal army, but there are not a large variety of units in each type, hopefully more will be added in the future. Campaign cut scenes are very amusing and I found myself looking forward to each one, which made learning the campaign isn't complete all that much more disappointing. As it currently is DNO is a great little game, and with more features to be added it should be worth looking forward to what comes next!

+Gameplay (Feels like warcraft 1/2 base building, troop building with sprinkles of AoE.)
+ Story missions, simple premise but branching options (on second map) add variety to the gameplay. The missions are also laid out in simple cutscene dialogues which are funny.
+ Loop of gathering, building, and combat is fun.
+Various gamemodes seem pretty cool. There is a challenge mode where I am sure that I will dip my toes in to once at least. But these are on top of endless (akin to a sandbox mode) and the story mode.

- The biggest negative at the moment is progression stops at an early halt. 

What this means: 

- Early troop upgrades are useless because those troops will be outclassed soon.
- Last tier of troops can be achieved pretty early on in the playthrough.
- Trebuchets and siege weapons are the strongest compared to land troops. Very little use for land troops.

If the troops had upgrade paths that made them viable and fun to play even throughout later stages of the playthrough, said upgrade paths would be worth spending in to.

Progression stopping at a halt means each and every playthrough will relatively be the same because trebuchets will be just spammed all over your base.  Troops hardly find any use in the defense, unless your defenses get breached.

Game needs: More viable troops, exciting upgrade paths. It would be nice to see some random events sprinkled in that could aid or be detriment to the player to spice up gameplay. Perhaps a merchant that stops by the market that stocks with different upgrade blueprints. Perhaps even a blueprint to train unique troops, or weapons stuff like that. Or even unique bosses to battle.  

Game has lots of potential and it will be interesting where it goes. What else can the devs do with the story mode, if in endless mode progression halts fast, will it just be more of the same? As of now 2/13 story missions have been released thus far. What is going to spice up that gameplay?

SHOULD YOU BUY THIS at the moment: No. Core gameplay is good, but progression halts very early and your next playthrough will be more or less the same thing of what you built.  

When should you buy this game? When the devs have addressed said issues and seeing what story mode really has to offer. If it is just endless mode with a barebones story on unique story mission maps, well then, we have seen all that we have wanted to see.

How does not choosing diplomacy affect the world in which you are King? Will there allies along the way? So on and so forth.

This is the hardest negative I have had to give in a long time because it is on the cusp of being so great, but time will tell.",1663906099,1663906571,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

So, it's challenging, it's fun, it's well designed.

121401402,76561197983229174,0,11,941,0,863,1661830809,english,"Really fun. Combines the best parts of roguelike city builders and medieval style RTS games with many systems that engage each other in satisfying ways without being overly complicated.

The game runs as fast as you want to: you can adjust game speed on the fly and pressing the spacebar pauses/plays the game. You have full control of the game while it it paused: give as many commands as you like and you can unpause the game and see them carried out. This means that as a new or experienced player keeping your thumb on the spacebar means that you always have time to stop, evaluate the situation, then make a decision, whether you are microing away a weak troop or plotting out the layout of your city.

Combat is not overly complicated but super satisfying. While the game does advertise itself as a ""wave defense"" type of game, where you have to fend off a large wave of enemies every four or five in-game days, in reality combat is a constant part of the game. You will need to micro your armies always in order to scout out the fog of war and clear out bandits which dwell around the map, in small camps or very, very large ones. You'll be using a small handful of troops to slaughter many times their number in the early game clearing bandits away from forests, minerals and food sources. Luckily all of your troops have out-combat health regeneration, and the enemy AI is fairly simple and easy to out-micro. Neither of these things are too dumbed down though: the health regen is modest and will not make up for bad decisions, and the enemy AI may be simple but it does have some tricks to keep you on your toes. Most notably, bandits will stray from their camps and into your base and start attacking civilians and structures. Outside of fortifications, there is no ""passive defenses""; if you do not have manpower availible to respond in time, I have seen a small handful of bandits do damage ranging from a major inconvenience to entirely ruining a two-hour long run by blowing up a fully stocked Granary and throwing me deep into food debt. In short, combat is big part of the game and you'll be glad to know that is is satisfying and well paced, between rewarding you for constant skirmishing as well as providing large-scale battles to pour lots of resources into defending against.

The logistical side of the game is really where everything shines and sets the pace for the entire game. You will need a lot of resources. A lot of food, a lot of wood, a lot of stone, a lot of steel. Later on you'll need Coin as well. Natural resources are scattered around your base, sometimes easy to get to, and sometimes not so much. In order to gather the resources fast enough to do something useful with them before you're overrun, you're going to need a lot of manpower. How do you get more workers? You need a lot of houses. Houses increase your maximum population cap and how many new people you have access to every morning. And they take up a lot of space. You'll learn pretty quickly that you will need to be really, really smart about how you place buidlings in this game. The longstanding consequences of a poorly placed Storage Pile can have you cursing yourself an hour along down the line when you're trying to maximize space for population buidings. Your soldiers, and (more importantly) workers cannot move through buildings. You'll always want to have clear avenues for people to move around while also cramming as much stuff as you can into as small of a space as possible, because you can only clear the map so quickly without investing too much into early army and hampering your long term economic health. Did I mention that you need manpower for troops too? And if any of your troops die, they will leave behind a corpse that needs to be manually picked up and dragged to a cemetery, which is an expensive task that can mean a few careless deaths clearing out early bandit camps can do a lot of damage in the long run. The theme you might have noticed so far is that you need to make a lot of important decisions very quickly, which may seem demanding, but because of the ""real time with active pausing"" system it never feels unfair or overwhelming.

If you've actually read this so far I'm going to assume you're interested, and if you want my opinion, the game is worth it's price. It's an ""Early Access"" title but there's enough in the game currently that you can get your money's worth, then come back later when they've added new stuff. If you decide to pick up the game, just don't forget about Watchtowers. They're in the defense tab and they can save you a lot of headaches when you're spending a lot of wood in the early game and there's not enough resources/time/space to start walling up to keep out wandering enemies in between waves.",1661736790,1661736790,True,5,0,0.581089138984680176,0,True,False,True

120936274,76561197993374580,264,12,812,0,812,1656770426,english,"This is a game I've wanted for quite some time, and it has not disappointed. It is a very fun, unique and dare I say 'cute' approach to the RTS/Tower Defense genre that scratches all the itches I have. Dev on it is steady and when content patches come out they are rather meaty so I don't get my panties in too big of a twist when they come a few months apart from one another.

It is very smooth and elegant for what it is in its current state and I haven't experienced a bug or issue yet. I wish I could code like these folks do. Outside of some balancing issues (and what game doesn't experience that in its development) I'd say buy this up immediately, it's a very good time. The short story thus far is also very humorous and witty, I rarely skip a scene because the humor strikes even when I know it's coming.

My suggestions thus far in the game would be more enemy types, a more strategic AI, and probably a nerf to trebuchets. 
[b] Enemies: [/b] Could use a short ranged combat unit that you have to pay attention to and focus on. Keeping to the theme of filthy peasants perhaps people throwing rocks or using slings instead of a sophisticated bow/crossbow. They could also use a hunter style unit that went after your soldiers/people specifically. Perhaps a hunting dog that could burrow under walls and chew up your peasants/soldiers but wall units are safe.

[b] AI: [/b] It seems at a certain point each level that defense stops becoming the main concern and shifts toward resources/supply. Enemy waves tend to come from 2/3 directions tops and once secured in those directions, you can leave entire sections of your fortress empty or even open. If there was some kind of 'defensive power' stat that the AI analyzed before picking an attack route before each wave, that would make levels not only more replayable, but much more interesting. Example: archers have stat of 1, a wooden wall has a stat of 2. North wall has a 3 wall section with 2 archers, south has 1 and 1, east has none, and west has 2 archers. Prior to the wave, the AI calculates the power based upon the compass directions and effectively divides the map into a big X in quadrants. It'll have a much, much higher % chance to attack from the east because it has the weakest defense stat.  

[b] Trebuchets: [/b] God damnit these things are so fun and awesome, but really, after building about 4-5 of them, you've won whatever level you're on. I don't think the power of them needs to be nerfed, actually with my thoughts to changes on them perhaps even buffed a little. I think they need to be permanent fixtures like a building once 'deployed' somewhere, increase their minimum range so they can't shoot targets within range 5 and a worker peasant assigned to them like a resource node. Each time they shoot, a peasant needs to run and get a stone from storage and bring it back to load. This provides players with choices to risk resource storage closer to front lines in order to shoot more often, and makes trebuchet's a more strategic choice of placement as they are effectively a building once deployed. You would also think twice about building random towers with trebuchets on them all over the map if you were risking peasants, stone, and pathing into your fortress to do so.

All in all, a fantastically fun game, one that I've sat down to play with the intention of putting in an hour, and looking at the clock to find 3 has gone by. I'm very excited to see where this goes from here.",1660997783,1660997783,True,20,1,0.705279886722564697,0,True,False,True

For example, if you only want to build your dream city in peace, you can turn off the enemy altogether. 

However this game is very much a work in progress, it needs more content on all three aspects of the game. The city building part is especially lacking in depth: there needs to be more building types and complex mechanics for it to be interesting. As of right now, RTS and tower defense seem to be their main focus, city building feels more like a supplement to them. I enjoyed taking a small army to explore the surroundings and uncover the fog of war, and occasionally using my cavalry to crush the enemies, but there isn’t much else you can do with your units. Things like different formations, active skills, and flanking bonus from the Total War series will be good additions to the game. I also would like to see more defense towers added to the game. Currently, you just put your archers and siege weapons on the wall and that’s it. 

On a side note, this game desperately needs more Steam Cloud storage space. 100MB is simply not enough, considering that a single save file is 6 to 8MB.

The easiest makes it so no enemies spawn which I figured wouldn't be as fun. 

The first wave appears as I'm still building. Cool no biggie I have units. I wipe them out and continue upgrading and building my forces. My kingdom is lookin great and I like how this games flow is set up. 

Then the second wave appeared...

A dark cloud of enemy units DOZENS of times larger than anything I've seen so far come raging from off map like a mass of starving locusts. In literal seconds my entire kingdom is no more.

1. You share defensive and building resources, want a group of archers? that's fewer workers to make food to keep the archers alive (yes units starve to death, then turn into zombies and attack from wherever they died) 
2. A.I pathways, they suck, you put down a tree hut, lower the zone so they don't wander too far to cut trees, so they go ahead and walk right through a raider camp, that's outside the designated zone you made for them, and guide those lovely raiders right back into your city before you're ready.
3. difficulty scale, this one is hard to be constructive about. wave one you fight maybe 20 people, wave 2 you're at about 200, wave 3 you're at about 500-600 hundred raiders including siege engines, and larger stronger enemies, wave 4? who knows, I've never been able to get that far. I even went as far as to create 6 layers of walls with about 30 archers per wall, and as many sword-men, I could fit in that time frame, they got devoured.
4. performance. it's a crap shoot.
5. variety, not a ton


other than the glaring issues the game is very fun, if you like playing for 30 minutes, restarting, and playing again, kinda like an old school demo!

Technical:
- Saves of more than a few hours of gameplay in Endless mode will not load within reasonable timeframe (30 min or less). This is the dealbreaker for me.
- Game running for a while at higher wave sizes still suffers from significant performance drops - can be somewhat helped by restarting game, but then runs into the problem above. This is with a fairly powerful rig.

Game Balance:
- Diversity of units is very limited. While it appears as though there are many units (~8 infantry, 3 siege), half of them are completely replaced by later units (ie. Archer by Crossbowman, Swordsman by Spear/Hammerguy) and lose all relevance once you unlock the later units (fairly quickly).
- Ballista is overshadowed by both Catapult and Trebuchet in all noticeable applications. It lacks a useful niche (like good DPS or range to counter enemy catapults) to make up for having no AoE, something that the other 2 have in droves.
- Upgrade system is too barebones - upgrades generally apply to only one unit, with no further progression or synergy.

I did feel that this game is missing a bit of the character of the old Stronghold games - the campaign text is funny but it might at times be a little *too* silly. It can be fun to have heroic, brave, or more interesting characters thrown in the mix as well. Also, without voice acting for the campaign, it essentially boils down to watching a long cutscene of just text bubbles, which definitely made me miss how that was handled in Stronghold. 

This game is still early access, obviously. The campaign isn't done yet, but the 3 missions I played were a blast. I hope they incorporate more story persistent elements (for instance, I let my peasant revolt hero die accidentally and didn't see any acknowledgement of that in the cutscene dialogue, although I can chalk that up to the game being in early access.

I managed to reach day 70 in endless mode on max difficulty, only to be beaten by not having anything to plug holes or even fix walls/towers/troops. I simply got overrun as there was no way for me to acquire more stone or iron.  A trading cap of selling max 300 wood every 2 minutes is way to slow in the latter rounds.  By the time a new wave arrives you may have traded 900 wood for 150 iron or 300 stone, which is fuck all in this game and barely a small wall or a few towers. 

Another problem is that this game works with a coin system only obtainable trough that already limited market, so you'll have to spend time on that as well, which further limits your options for stone and iron. They either need to add a more complex market system, allow (way) higher amounts to be traded at once or add a way to have unlimited stone and iron. 

There's also the problem that if you want to focus on enemy artillery you'll need to do it manually, as there's only an ""attack nearby"" and ""attack strongest"" option. Problem is that enemy catapults are not considered in both these options. It would be nice if there was a button to specifically focus on enemy artillery, with for example ballistas (who can use a range upgrade as right now they're very weak and useless).
EDIT: according to the FAQ this is getting fixed next update.

If you're looking to buy this game to see how long you'll survive don't bother (yet). It has a lot of potential and is very fun, but until then i can't really recommend it, unless you maybe do the missions, which i personally don't care about. I heard they're reworking late game economics so I'd wait until then, right now it's a no, but like i said, has a shit ton of potential.",1656251309,1657726611,False,1,0,0.512987017631530762,0,True,False,True

BUT I'm gonna start with a big con here, the game might be TOO challenging. It is very fast paced. You NEED to multitask, kinda all the time. You need to manage your resources, food, population while building up an army so you can defend yourself against waves and other outposts on the map. The fast paced is because you only get 3-4 in-game days before the next wave comes, which is bigger and always stronger. And at the end every single outpost you did not clear, will attack you + 5 big waves at once. 
Yes. You're done, it's almost impossible.

It's all about management and choices really. 

But this aside, the game is great. The building options, upgrading, resources, population, placing your army or katapults on the walls for bigger range etc it's really well done. It's so satisfying to build an really big army and position them next and behind eachother. 

It's well made, for an early access game, no bugs so far, no crashing. Running the game is smooth
And yeah, there's also so much potential that can make this game 10 times better. But time will tell how that turns out

117333175,76561198059058036,465,5,918,0,786,1705100659,english,"Endless Castle Defense, exactly the kind of thing I've been looking for. A single player RTS, essentially, where the enemy is always advancing on you from outside the map, with a few enemy camps scattered across the map for you to loot. Many different difficulty settings on endless mode, although the difficulty ramp seems to bring even the easiest, non-peaceful map a little too intense too quickly imo. By wave 12, invasions were lasting multiple days. Which would probably mean that if you can last long enough and your PC can handle it, you'll eventually reach waves that just don't end due to new invasions starting before the previous one is cleared out. I would love to reach that point personally, but so far have been unable to, mostly due to player skill.

Only slightly buggy for an Early Access title; although the game for me ran very smooth until I'd reached 100+ in-game days, with the 15th wave creating massive armies coming from all sides. Sometimes workers get stuck for no apparent reason (farmers for example, being stuck on the farm with no walls or other buildings nearby.) 

The 3 minute warning system for where invasions will be coming from is great. However, before dumping a decent amount of resources into walls/towers for a particular corner, it's better to spread them out at the beginning. An invasion marker is only an estimate, and committing too much to defending a single spot can see your town overrun by a file of enemies slightly off course from the where the marker had been.

The game is definitely not quite finished for long, endless games. I would very much like to see an expanded research tree, and a greatly improved market to help with increasing game length. If not for being locked to a single market where you can only trade 300 wood for 100 stone/50 iron per minute, I could easily see those endless invasions being reached. Or even being able to automate the market would be huge. As it stands, it either takes too many resources or too much time to have a base that takes up nearly a full map that's also well-defended.

The cartoony graphics are great for this, especially when getting smacked by catapults that launch everything around the impact into the air. The pace of the game is honestly fantastic and I've already lost several hours to ""just one more wave.""

There is also a campaign, but I honestly only did the first level. It did seem pretty fun, and at the very least the first level has a fun little story to it. I just have no interest in barely getting started before reaching a victory screen and having to begin again.

Aside from that, some things I would personally consider to be neat changes:

1) Enemy AI focusing on gates or openings rather than attacking whatever wall they run into. Otherwise gates and walls instead of just endless loaded towers feel useless.
2) Improved positioning. As it stands, whatever you have selected forms an automatic formation, which is great, but it can be very difficult to get them to face the direction you want; especially when selecting a group made up of a variety of troops.
3) Greatly increased/removal of Builder range. I can appreciate how worker ranges/targets work in this game, but I feel like Builders should not be affected by this limitation. 
4) Maybe a research item, but would love to see Builder speeds increase, especially on walls/towers when the Invasion alert is active. Several times I would start building a Massive Tower when Invasion alerts activated, only to just barely have it build after the full 3 minutes.
5) Lower difficulty maps should scale in difficulty a little slower. 
6) An option for renewable Gems through either drops from invaders or through the Market, or some other end-game building; some way to continue getting them once you dominate the map. As it stands, it honestly doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me that the more powerful you become, the less access you get to powerful abilities that the Gems control.
7) Maybe this is in the game already and I just haven't seen it, but somewhere to see your resource income; food/wood/etc. Currently only see how much food is being used per day; a way to see how much food you are making each day would be fantastic.
8) A button to select all un-assigned units. The maps are massive compared to the units, and if you lose some units somewhere after not assigning them to a group/putting them in a building; you might never find them again.
9) An option to have some control over world-gen. Increasing/decreasing resources, mountains, water, etc, would be pretty sweet in a game like this. Or even just a way to control the world gen seed (copy/paste), so that you can share great starts with other players.

All that aside, TL;DR: The game is a blast, well worth the money even in Early Access if you enjoy Castle Defense, or even casual RTS games. And the Diplomacy ""option"" is a great touch.",1655778152,1655778339,True,2,0,0.503672599792480469,0,True,False,True

Synopsis: 8.5/10 | Easy going tower-defense with in progress campaign.
Pros: 
- Good, open, and consistent communication & updates from the team, probably 9 or 10/10 as far as well-run early accesses go.
- Fair price point for a game that when finished could be fairly priced at $45. Maybe get on sale if you're skeptical 
- Difficulty is good upon early adoption 
Cons: 
- Early Access, obviously diverse content is sparse
- After getting a hang of mechanics, any of the modes become a cake walk, becomes a city-builder 

Myself personally, I really enjoy chill laid back games to play while I watch sports, hence the long playtime, so don't think there is THAT much content to justify the playtime. 
After kind of ""mastering the mechanics"" I feel as though it has mostly become a city-builder (on any version of Endless mode) which is fine, because I like those too. But that is to say, late-game needs balancing work done. 
However, like I mentioned in my pros, this is one of the most responsive and well-intentioned teams I've seen operate an early-access. Community complaints are, if not patched, then responded too within the monthly updates, and patches are discussed at length on the steam page (which is such a far cry from other EA's that force you to join their forum or follow their socials, I forgot that it was even a thing), that if you enjoy the genre, you can know that this is clearly a passion project and that throughout EA you can contribute to the direction of the game and expect regular updates. 

Anyway, solid tower-defense game, rough but fun mechanics, and did I mention it's gorgeous? 8.5/10 

** Previous review:
8/10 from me, has work to do on balancing, such as timing of waves as well as adding in new content so it's more worthwhile to push for upgrades, but it's good enough in it's current state to justify its current price point.

Have got to say, this game can't come recommended enough if you enjoy challenging tower defense games. I've got to say, it's been awhile since I've been able to find a game in this genre that is able to strike a happy balance between ""shut-off brain and upgrade"" and rage inducing unfair mob fest. It's a game that rewards you for noticing your mistakes and inefficiencies when you lose, making it all the more satisfying when you win.
Also lends itself to replayability which is nice.

No tower defense game has held me so firmly by my tennis balls since I was 10 and was obsessed with AddictingGames|com. I mean, the 12 hours on record at the time of this review were recorded in the 3 days since I bought this game - which is insane for me, who usually just has games like Football Manager in the background while I code or watch videos.

First impression after 6 hours is I love this, its very hard even on the easiest settings but sometimes hard is very fun
What I like about it:
Very Simple and kinda fun tutorial
Nice building and not overly complicated with every building looking the same and clicking on everything trying to figure out what it is or does.
very informative tutorial that you don't really forget what you learned after it ends
pretty simple research upgrades with clear directions on how to get them
Diplomacy is not an option

Things I dont care or like:
When trying to defend against hoards my troops wanna go all over the place and not HOLD like I tell them to ( might be me not knowing how to hold them better )
Diplomacy is not an option

I would give this game a solid 8/10 for the 6 hours I've played and really enjoy this little game.

My main issue as of now is that even on Endless mode it feels as if you don't get enough time in between waves.

Making it every 10 days or every 15 would be great, allowing more time for defense to be built and to have town management to happen.  Cant wait to see updates, and hopefully see more house types, troop types, and maybe traps to be made to help repel attacks. Even the option to build wall catapult for heavy damage on the attackers.

Update: After some more time on the game I'm pretty sure the main problem is upgrading to tier 3 being very costly and the waves being way to large  at a very early start.

Here are some suggestions for dev.

1. Story mod map layout is fixed, not random, and with some encounter event.

2. Tech is not only for one type of unit. For example, Sharpshooter can both benifit archer and crossbowman.

3. Tier 1 unit can be upgradged to Longbowmen or Long Sword Soldier.

4. Units' status can be slightly higher with the exp they gain from battle.

5. More souce of food (Fish should be renewable resources, and hunting ect.

6. Auto trading (making exchange of food for stone and iron in later game easier.

7. More hero units, can buff surrounding normal units.

8. Units in story mode should be different when siding with the king or the rebels.

9. Siege warfare as the attackers? (More Siege unit like scaling ladder, battering ram ect.)

10. More defence unit like moat, barbed wire and so on.

11. Magician with attack magic, Necromancer who can summon zombie warrior, and Musketeers maybe?

12. Multiplayer mode and map editor.",1653095608,1653095608,True,6,0,0.588293552398681641,0,True,False,True

The game randomly crashes at some point after 30min of play time. Maybe it works for some people but I don't seem to be the only one.
I'm sure the devs will iron out these issues because they seem very capable but until then this is a frustrating experience.

Battles- to have  an enemy castle to siege

- a button to send the next wave right away

- bigger maps

- maybe a gold mine (could be heavily defended by rebels and you first have to free it)

- unique high end fighters (maybe like a wizard or Robin Hood or a Gregor Clegane or a bard)

- storage and granary lvl 4 (maybe subterranean or only buildable into a mountainside)
- (or) research options to unlock bigger storage space in the respective buildings

- research addons for available units (e.g., more range for archers or healing for swordsmen or stealth for healers) 

- maybe some reward for killing rebels (scum!) ... like 1 gold for every 50 rebels from a wave or some of these magic stones (because you can't replenish the latter once all rebel settlements have been .... liberated)

- also, the records for how many days you lasted should update not just when you die, but also upon saving the game

https://youtu.be/NjjVVInJcNw

Diplomacy Is Not An Option is a real-time city builder focused primarily around turtling, or hunkering down and building up defenses in order to defeat waves of enemies. It’s similar to They Are Billions, a zombie-focused city-builder that came out of a few years ago. They Are Billions is notorious for it’s difficulty, and while Diplomacy Is Not An Option is no walk in the park, it is much more accessible to newcomers. It also has a colorful, lively art style and sense of humor, the later of which is nothing special.

The setup is silly and mostly pointless. You are a bored king who’s decided to abandon his responsibilities to his people. This leads to unrest and riot, but actually it just provides an excuse for massive mobs of enemies to storm your castle walls. The story bits that set up the campaign and run between missions are very bare bones. At this point there’s no voice acting and little in the way of animation. As it stands they are pretty boring and don’t really hit home the humor they seem to be aiming for. Luckily you can skip them and get right to the action.

That’s where Diplomacy Is Not An Option really shines. You have to quickly transform your meager settlement and handful of units into a formidable defense. To do this you must collect various resources like wood and stone, while also providing food to your ever growing populace. Like the best of these games, Diplomacy Is Not An Option is a delicate balancing act. You have limited resources, including works to perform jobs, so you have to prioritize right from the start. Luckily it’s easy to shuffle worker around and get your town on task early on.

The first few waves of enemies are simple to deal with, but things quickly ramp up. You’ll soon have to begin walling in your city and making educated guesses on where to begin. Each wave comes from a different, random direction and you’re only a given a few minutes notice as to where it will be coming from. This leads to last minute building that you can hopefully afford and quickly requisition your builders to erect. Often times you’ll be fighting off pitchfork wielding peasants with a half-built wall and poorly positioned guard towers. Thankfully you can quickly make some soldiers to help literally fill in the gaps in your defense.

While Diplomacy Is Not An Option is considerably easier than similar games like They Are Billions, it’s definitely no cake walk. The waves ramp up considerably and it’s very easy to get caught with your pants down. However, there are several difficulty options to make the game easier, or harder, and the penalties for letting small batches of enemies through are low. It just launched in early access, but already has a robust research tree and several tiers of upgradable buildings. Right now if features an endless survival mode and two campaign missions. However, you can see dozens of missions they plan to add once the game leaves early access. It seems like Diplomacy Is Not An Option already has a solid foundation that will only get better the more Door 407 builds upon it.",1652286609,1652286609,True,0,0,0.477941185235977173,0,True,False,True

I like to take the time though to think and speak about what improvements can be made. 
The first category of these Ideas would be the: ""Please change that, it annoys me"": 

1. Placing buildings should be easy. 
I don't care and don't want to care about people not beeing able to reach buildings. 
Either lat me place them whereever I want, or automatically put streets in between. 
The reason is, that building castles, cities etc. should: 
a. result in a castle that looks good 
b. be realistic 
c. be fast, since you need to concentrate to defend your stuff. 

2. Gold is wierd. It slows everything down. The only case where slowing things down with the current gold system are trebuchets because they are overpowerd. 
But just in technical terms: 
In order to get gold the user has to: 
a. reach castle level 3
b. build a market (which isn't that obivous todo) 
c. have resource availible
d. click on a button in the market (why, isnt it where you build building e.g.? Why the extra click?) 
e. wait till the things are traded (~2min) 
f. Repeat the process after you only hear an indication that the market is ready again.  
Now the issue is: this is very inflexible and you forget about the market and therefore get out of gold very quickly. 

How to do it better: 
a. have an internal market where you can exchange all resources over gold. (e.g. Stellaris Energy credits, Stronghold gold, etc. ) 
b. There are better means to nerv trebuchets (just more resources, longer training times etc.) 
c. To get gold you take taxes from the people. Its basically whats the story about isnt it ;)? 

3.Range of some buildings, like the cemetary. Although a cool idea, but if I raid the peasants I dont want to build a cemetary near it because one soldier died. Also note, that you discourage offense in favour of defense, that way. 

4. The game is sometimes rather undynamic. 
I mean that it is slow and expensive to build armys, and with the cemetary mechanic, fights are discouraged. Compare that to Age of Empires and similar, where its encouraged to fight, and loose armys if need be. 
So I recommend more waves and a faster and easier way to train troops. 

Now the category: ""That would be cool!!""

1. Train troops not soldiers. The only game that I know, does that properly would Lord of the Rings: Battle of Middle Earth 1 & 2. There you can train a troops instead of one soldier which leads to epic battles really quickly. 

2. Walls: First of all: why can't I put troops on walls? Second: Why are stone walls so thin? They aren't fences. But I like them visually. The style is great. Maybe improve the visualls for diagonal walls. Here you can take inspiriation from Stronghold and Lord of the Rings: Battle of middle Earth 1 (not 2) 

3. The enemy are peasants, but they bahave like zombies. I know you probably got inspired by They are Zillions, but they are still peasants. And peasants can use bows, can make leaders and most importantly: Ramms. The classical weakpoint of any castly is the gate, and therefore an an enemy would target that weakpoint and will not attack the closest point of wall. 

4. Kavalary needs some love: First its very expensive and time consuming to create the predominant kind of middle aged military due to the gold mechanic. Secondly, they cannot overrun infantary. This looks somewhat wierd (like in Age of Empires where the elephant stops to hit a citizen a few times). You already let soldiers fly on catapult inpact, so I think it would be cool if the cavalary can charge the enemy. (Inspired by Lord of the Rings: Battle of Middle Earth) 

5. Please let me play against an other castle. Then all the siege weaponry makes sense, and you have a more dynamic gameplay then a tower defence, against waves. 

6. Castle upgrades, where you can build towers to the castle, that are pre-positoned. This would get around the current ""street""-system. 

7. I like the magic system, but I find it a bit overpowered. Maybe instead have a new soldier type: Magician, that has a specific range, or make them less op than the meteor. Although it looks quite cool, destroying a big wave with a meteor, I admit. 

8. I find myself only building walls, when I see the direction where the wave is coming from, in order to save resources. 
However a castle is not a wall between 2 mountains to block braindeads that can't figure out another way around the wall. I would recommend more smaller waves, and attacks from more directions in order to force the player to build a proper castle. 

so that what I could think of. I only concentrated on mechanics because I think you are creative enough for story and content. I would expect more enemy types, and you could go more into fantasy if you want (trolls, dragons, demons, etc.). 

Generally I like the game, and I am looking forward on what you will make of it.

It would be very nice to tell Units to Attack incoming [b]Siege[/b].

Sometimes 3 or more trebuchets get mixed up and then just go around in circles. 
Also sometimes too many units gather in one place, e.g. crossbowmen, and then they form a clump.

I would love to see this evolve.

 You can play either the campaign (in which there is 2 or 3 missions at present), or endless mode.  In either case, you have to build up your kingdom while maintaining your resources and food, and building up your army.  DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE your angry villagers.  Know what a Zerg is?

Build houses to increase your population while balancing food intake/outake; acquire different types of soldiers, have gravedigger houses that will bury your dead (if you don't, they rise into an enemy unit), watch out for plague, erect defensive walls and towers, and more.

Tech tree is a little limited, but makes sense if the gametime is meant to be shorter.

You have to balance a flawless economy and a perfect military force to ensure your castle survives to the stronger and stronger waves coming at you. You left some corpses of yours into an expedition and you think it's fine? Well if you don't build enough gravediggers in a sufficient time, watch your dead soldiers returning as zombies to take your crown once their bodies rot, the same rotten bodies making your villagers sick and transmitting the disease to each other leading to an epidemic. You have built enough dravediggers? Well now you have to protect the graveyard because if the latter is destroyed, the same amount of zombies spawn and add themselves to the mass of rebelling peasants.

But zombies aren't the only problem, as there's gravity taken into account, economic issues, starvation droughts as you have to manage the hunger of your citizens along with the influx of population coming every day.

This game keeps crashing at later stages of the game. 
Not to mention fps drops to 15fps on later enemy waves (not a potato pc)

I managed to get to day 58 on hardest difficulty on endless. 80k kills.

Had a crash almost every day since day 38, and the only reason I lost on 58 is because I got bored of micromanaging my towers to target hundreds of enemy siege 1 by 1. 
Can't even shift click on enemy...

Never managed to get so many enemies on the map as it's being advertised on the screenshots.

Zombies seem to be allied with the raiders...

Prepare to micro-micromanage your every tower to target enemy siege weapons. 
Why isn't is a setting? You have one for targeting nearest and strongest enemy.

Prepare to trade 150-300 resources for 7-30 gold every 2 minutes.

Prepare to get frustrated with your citizens getting stuck on each other or corners of buildings.

If you liked They Are Billions and like medieval setting you will like this, that is until you run into all those issues I mentioned above.

There were a few other issues I had but can't remember them now.

Attack indicators on the mini map make seeing where attacks are occurring a lot easier, in addition to material harvests being more fair. Other modes have been added so you can enjoy more than just the two levels they have available. Rogue units are still a thing as of writing this given that its easier to keep units and citizens from dying from hunger or being killed from aforementioned changes.

Original Review: This would be a good game if not for the fact this game as of now only has two levels. I get it's in early access but come on. In addition, the rouge units being able to sneak in to my city and start causing damage is a nightmare to deal with especially on the easiest setting. In addition, with the maps being randomly generated, that  can make or break a run on a level. Also the way you can train units is also a bit of a hassle. In RTS's I've played before, as long as you have the resources and haven't gone over the unit cap, you are free to create units. In DiNO, you have create more population through houses which take resources, in addition most units also require resources that you need to spend AND you can only get more units when a day in game has passed. This creates a rough scenario if you need units stat.

Theres also the issue that I always seemed to run into never having enough food for my city. Either resource gathering is too slow (even with research) or the payout for food and resources is too little. And if you don't have enough food, your city begins to starve which results in not being able to create new units for battle AND if it goes on for long enough citizens and troops will start dying. The dead need to be buried lest they spread disease, and undertakers can be killed just like every citizen or unit. And if bodies haven't been buried, they become zombies, which will in turn attack your city. The thing is, having all of this creates a stupidly delicate system where you're micromanaging your city more than you are commanding your army to complete levels. When you start losing citizens to enemy forces, this causes major disruptions to your city which ultimately causes a negative feedback loops where you just end up in an uphill battle just to win a map.

The game shouldn't be that hard. There's honestly just too much going on and too much relying on the day night cycle that just to keep moving forward. And again the rogue units are also a pain in the rear because you can hardly ever tell where they are.",1647328240,1690870497,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Plenty of reviews calling it a mix of Tower defence and Age of Empires, and that's exactly what you're getting, and its fabulously addicting. Maybe my review won't get read or noticed but I have to clear the air with some criticism and suggestions in hopes of improving the game. (I KNOW it is Early Access, and that's precisely why I am about to state the following)

Negatives ( at the moment of writing):
- Crashes during later waves... right now that's a game killer, after the amount of hours you put into building your defences for a crash to happen over and over on the same wave, even after saving... quite frustrating.
- Resources deplete too fast, makes it too hard for you to plan scaling your base.

Suggestions for improvements:
- Options to improve resource depletion efficiency during late game ( as there is forester for wood, and farms for food), or regeneration of stone and iron deposits.
- An option to select and move multiple units which are in towers, and an ability to move units from tower to tower directly.
- An option to upgrade weaker units into stronger ones directly, instead of dismissing and recruiting new ones, and maybe later branching of unit upgrades into different specialisations.
- An option to deactivate the ''hold attack'' stance on units without needing to move them.
- The presence of a game encyclopedia with information about foe types, weaknesses, strengths.
- Other means of obtaining gold, such as maybe sparse gold mines to be extracted by respective gold collection building type.
- Perhaps, an ability to promote units after a certain number of kills by the unit, which may come with stat and/or cosmetic enhancements.
- Co-op mode ? Build together with a friend and protect against the waves, exchange materials, plan out base building, sounds fun to me at least.
- I have heard this one on multiple other reviews so I guess I'll support it here as well... more magic related units, you know the usual fire for burning, ice for slowing...blah blah...

The way in which you can define the action zones of certain buildings (e.g. gatherers or lumberjacks) needs to be improved. For example, instead of choosing the centre of the zone and then frantically clicking on the button to enlarge/shrink the zone, it would be more practical to simply right-click and drag.
In the same way the AI of the builders should be improved or allow to have an efficient way to micromanage them, for example allow buildings to have the same building priority and let the AI choose which builder goes on which building in order to minimize unnecessary moves.
We should be able to put the market in automatic mode, we define which resource we want to sell and against what, and each time the airship comes back it leaves as soon. Or else to have a queue of trades to do that are done automatically each time the airship comes back.
The AI of catapults and trebuchets should also be improved, when it is set to ""attack the nearest enemy"" it should nevertheless make it possible to type in a way to take maximum advantage of zone damage.
Similarly when it comes to targeting the strongest enemies, the name is ambiguous and it should be possible to choose exactly what type of enemy to target first.
Also it should be possible to remove several buildings at once, possibly with a confirmation popup.
We should also be able to garrison a whole wall with archers at once instead of having to garrison them one by one, it's so annoying that I've given up on the idea of placing archers on it.",1647047005,1647047005,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,True

+ Cool graphical style. Works well for this type of game.

+ Good variety of buildings and units. 
+ Interesting tech tree with lots of options. It's difficult to choose which research to go with, but that's how it should be.

Negatives:
- Difficulty is a little unbalanced. You can make it easier by choosing the easiest difficulty, but where's the fun in that? Also, your choices in the game affect how difficult it is. Want to side with the people and fight the monach? Yeah, it's going to be harder than siding with the king and fight peasants. 
- Not a ton of content at the moment, but it is in early access, so that's to be expected. Thankfully, you get a lot of mileage out of the content that is there.

I tend to put a lot and a lot of hours into games I enjoy, and while I haven't done so with this one yet, I think the promised future content, the comedic pitch of the campaign, and the sense of escalating difficulty are all draw-ins for something I can soak countless hours into. 

At a glance, this game is They Are Billions but played as a medieval lord. Saying this, there are some specific mechanics that are specifically changed from TAB that, in my opinion, are massive upgrades. There is no power radius for towers in order to show you where you can build. People have to walk to their jobs and back to wherever they need to store their goods, but there are very very few limitations on building (short of a perimeter around the edge of the map). 

With the full range of options of buildings, you are also capable of building a Stronghold-tier castle, complete with periphery buildings you do not defend behind walls and the more important Keep and Castle structures all locked tight behind walls. If you want to play like this is TAB and expand all over the map, the only limitation is how much food you can dish out to people because there are, as of writing, no self-automated defenses. Every person you want to keep from damaging you needs to be dealt with by a person you hire. 

I played the campaign (though making a specific choice seems to lock you out of the other option, and I'm unsure if you can reset your efforts to see the other side) as it stands for now, which for me was only two missions. I played a 4 hour session of the demo and another 4 hour session today. The content is all really good where it is, which impresses me for a month after going into early access. 

There are a few problems: your people have to pathfind to their jobs, and sometimes they will walk right out to the enemy if they get confused. Builders will wall themselves in. Endless doesn't (at least not in early days) seem to make use of the enemy variety established in the campaign. The enemy's directives for what they want to attack in their path seems a little odd and inconsistent sometimes.

But overall? I am loving my experience with the game, and it is an easy recommend to me. 25 dollars might be a bit steep if you do not like endless modes or only want structured content, but for me, this is well worth it. I hope this game continues to impress!",1646547595,1646547595,True,2,0,0.469696968793869019,0,True,False,True

If you are a fan of games like StarCraft or base defense games in general, you should really enjoy this one! Many of the mechanics we already know are well executed and the controls are very similar, so learning is very easy. There's not much to complain about, but I do want to point out some balance issues that I found to reduce the flow of the game for me. In the beginning of the rounds, base building has a great balance between resource gathering and construction. It's very easy to develop a flow and balance everything you need to advance. However, there's a point where you have to build a ""Market"" that is designed to somehow generate a new resource (by that point), a gold coin. This coin is a requirement to upgrade buildings and certain units. I unfortunately couldn't get this to work, even when trading for resources that I didn't need. The ability to trade for resources only becomes valuable when you get a map that doesn't spawn a specific resource within your starting area... I assume. This rarely happens however, so this building becomes extremely pointless for me and forced my strategy to successfully function without it. Maybe it's a glitch or something I was doing wrong, but after ten trades in one round, I was unable to generate one single coin. So I found that you can just create an old ""Zerg"" defense setup to overcome the lack of upgrades allowed by this building. I have beat the couple rounds that the game currently has, but I am a little frustrated that I haven't been able to see or try ANY of the buildings or units that require these coins. With all that being said, I still think it's a great game! With it still being in development, I'm sure we'll see some adjustments/fixes that will make things like this much better.

This game has some great potential and is a great addition to the genre! With the fun humor, well balanced difficulty, and attention to quality, this game goes high on my recommendation list.

overall highly recommend anyone to try the game, its very fun.

Good City Builder, good Castle Defense. 
It can get tough when you first start playing it on Wave 3, but after you get a hang of it gets pretty easy 

Suggestions 
Need more variety in troops more resources to collect more ways to get food 
There should be a system where you can attack other Villages The Peasant Villages like a world map to go out and attack other things and build more Villages 
there need to be more wall types there could be moats trenches
 The market needs to be automated 
peasants need to have a more attacking utility such as archers Siege machines and Mages 
should be more ways to set up your troops in defensive stands and some more ways to control them better 
Needs more magic items and more ability and more ways to get crystals to use the abilities 
also, I think in the later Rounds around 20 the game gets pretty easy when you have a massive amount of troops and walls 

set up but overall it's a solid game and you should get it if it's on sale or not

[b] Changes and ideas [/b]: Starting I understand that the game is in early access and it can be expected that these suggestion will come to light in future production of the game. Starting with troops, every troop seems to have a major purpose to your armies and do a very good job for what they are. However, the horsemen are by far the most useless troop as they are only used for scouting which is preferred to be done in larger groups, i don't believe that they should cost 1 coin as coins are fairly hard to obtain and can only be gained by trade or carts. Implementing an upgrade within the upgrade/skills tree to allow them to do a charge attack which does small spread of splash damage to surrounding enemies would greatly imp-rove the overall use of this troop, allowing for a cavalry group to conduct a team charge to clear out lines of enemies, other wise i have never really used them and still hoping they get an upgrade. (hoping to see a lot more troops of all types as well, both enemies and friendlies). The ballistics although having great aim and damage is set to single targets making it rather useless and hope that perhaps enemy giants to combat walls will be introduced to bring use to these single hard hitting machines and please set them to attack stronger targets constantly rather than small infantry. 

Iron and stone farming, within late game of endless mode you seem to run out of iron and stone deposits therefore relying on trade, for wood, foresters cabins are a great addition to the game perhaps underground mining areas should be implemented allowing to access gems as well which should stay rare. Berry pickers are quite useless in my opinion when reaching town hall 2 as farms are way more productive and useful. Implementing captains of battalions, sometime the need of one army to support another in an event of an invasion is necessary however mixing the troops up by accident and not knowing which fallen soldiers belonged to either squad can be annoying, By implementing a captain means when moving the squad of those who belong to that original squad will move with him, squads should also be highlighted as different colours for example squad 1 is blue squad 2 is green etc would greatly help army management. Also along the lines when highlighting an entire squads of arches and crossbow men to be placed along walls only one can be placed at a time i think if you highlight the entire squad and move them to a wall they should also take position on neighbouring walls.

I hope that a conquest game mode against AI or multiplayer is implemented. In this game mode is can be a 2 - 4 kingdoms game mode, in this example i will use 2 kingdoms in a 1v1. The goal is to capture as many encampment sites, gather and create a chain of supply lines etc to allow each player in an arms race to build their kingdoms and armies then set out to take even more encampments or attack each others kingdoms aiming for town hall, overall who ever has the last standing town hall or most points from encampments captured and secured wins. I believe a fun and competitive game mode against AI or actual players would greatly add variety in game modes to this game. Different campaign mission as i feel there will be many although there will be different settings of lands i believe constantly defending and searching for camps all day long with get tedious and boring perhaps in some mission you attack enemies perhaps? 

Campaign: I know a lot of people have been complaining about difficulty, and yes it is hard for an beginner, but as you improve and realise better placements of buildings, armies and time management it becomes a lot easier so perhaps a easier mode for beginners, also have a in game cosmetics and currency which can be gained for completing levels on higher difficulties otherwise why would you bother losing brain cells over the higher difficulties. 

I hope the development team sees and reads this post. As i really enjoy this game and will spend more hours within it. 
Overall the game has infinite potential and knowing that it is early access and most of the problems will be fixed encourages me to recommend it to other and wait for future updates.  Please don't rush :) Thank you

Randomly generated terrain gives possibilities - to boom or to build defenses. You never know in which position will the enemies come from. The huge horde is much easier because you know where will it come from and wall the place. But the sporadic raid is unpredictable. Many times I was just cleaning the surroundings when 4 knights suddenly comes from no where and killed tons of villagers. Even I have made watch towers and saw them coming, but when I saw them, it is already too late.

I think the king's story line should be difference from the Bloody Scott's line. Peasant's wave maybe sporadic, unorganized and huge numbered. But the king's army is well-trained. They have formations, discipline, tactics.

The endless mode, however, is just CPU burning. Watching trebuchet and the nuclear weapon shelling the peasants into the sky is a relief of stress. But when your FPS decreaseed you feel stress again. Even computer with GPU 3060 and CPU i7-11800H crashed at the 40th days horde. It is understandable that millions of enemies are generated together and each of them has a independent AI control. Just like 7dtd A20's horde, my suggestion is strengthen the peasants but reduce the number. Other way, maybe ask NASA if they have a spare computer.

Also, if this game just keeps defending yourself and always starts with one TC and several villagers, it will become boring soon. Perhaps learning from campaign mode in Age Of Empires. Such as, you completed 
a side mission, you get rewarded and the next wave will become easier. Or just start with a huge amount of armies who are far from home and don't have enough supplies. No TC, no villagers, and supposed to capture the city in 7 days. Or your ally is in danger, when we arrived we found it is a trap and so on.

110812169,76561198011428153,1001,27,271,0,271,1645598108,english,"TL:DR; Really fun RTS with similar mechanics to starcraft or age of empires, but is probably too difficult for most noobs in the genre to get far in the campaign. With some updates this should be perfectly fixable however so still worth checking out.



So I really fell in love with this game after trying out the demo. And I will say its certainly a fun casual rts game, especially if your a fan of games like starcraft or age of empires as it is very much like those sort of games but with a more casual spin. My biggest complaint about the game so far is its very difficult, even playing on the easiest setting I have been having alot of trouble beating the second mission in the campaign. And adding to that fact is that the maps seem to be randomly generated in the campaign as well which means I cant even build off of previous stategies or learn which way the enemy comes from first ect. So my tip for the devs is to make the easy difficulty actually easy and not such a struggle for a noob like me. The whole point of easy mode is for people who may have never played this sort of game to learn the ropes and not get frustrated, ive played alot of strategy games and similar games to this before so I know ""how"" to play them, so easy should by all means be easy to me. I would say tho that after 3 attempts of the third mission I have gotten to the final wave, but was no where near prepared for the final attack. so its clearly not completely unreasonable even for someone not great at these kinds of games. Id say make this current version of the game's ""Easy"" into a normal mode and scale the other modes appropriately. Other than that tho, and one crash I had, I have no other real complaints. And considering that the difficulty should be a fairly easy thing to tweak by simply changing some values, I would recommend giving easy more resources so its much easier to build up the walls and get some troops manning them quickly, I think for the most part enemy health is fine but on easy I would also scale down the number of enemy strong units that spawn on the map, things like catapults and the bigger heavier units should be in fewer numbers so its easier to destroy those camps so you will have more spells, without throwing troops into a meat grinder that ends up meaning you have no one to defend when the waves come. Alternatively just placing more days between waves may also work to lower the difficulty altho I imagine that may be harder to implement.",1645598772,1645598772,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Sadly my game crashes every time I'm halfway through wave 11 on my current endless run-through at medium difficulty, and the idea of starting a new run from the beginning is deflating. 

I really really enjoy the game and I'm not frustrated because it's very early access, but I'll wait a few months before picking it up again.

(Edit: This issue has also been fixed.)
Also, when I select one unit by clicking on it once, the game often decides to highlight every unit of it's type on my screen instead (as if I double-clicked.) This happens extremely frequently, to the point where most of my micromanagement time in battle was spent double-checking that I didn't accidentally select all of my archers when I'm only trying to send an individual to get on the wall. My mouse does not give my double click issues in other games.

Defence is satisfying but I'd love scenarios that have you go on the offence and siege other castles.

I hope they lean into the fantasy and magic aspects more. A mage tower that spawns wizards and generates magic crystals would be so cool.

PLAYING SUGGESTIONS:
1. AI is pretty weak, if you've played Homeworld before you can do that to most of the mobs. 
Think of the mobs as zerglings, don't get surrounded. just kite - u'll be ok ^^
2. You can also use the special power that drops 5 melee guys to divert incoming waves if you're not ready yet. just lead the wave away from your base.
3. Utilize SPACEBAR or pause as much as possible ^^
4. berries come back, so you can rotate your gatherers
5. when there is an incoming wave, save AS SOON AS SUNRISE of the DAY BEFORE (just before the timer comes out) - if the starting point of wave is hard to defend, just reload your save file. (no need to thank me - i don't like it much tho but can save you a lot in endless mode)

The challenge really is just the sheer number of mobs, beyond that, the city building is ok - not much you can do here though.

SOME ASKS FOR THE DEVELOPERS:
1. i'd like a multiplayer mode with like 3-4 people
2. ""guard"" feature for units of follow
3. public highscore table per difficulty
4. management feature for where builders are - they sometimes stop building
5. a mode where there is a randomized labyrinth I need to pass with very limited people that I can just upgrade
6. make melee or any warriors be able to help out with gathering trees or fishing/berries.. they should at least be able to do that much
7. obelisk power that makes you have like stimpacks
8. automated market
9. since there's not much magic, maybe just get some oil based fire or something for archers.. maybe poison tipped weapons? you can give poison to the royalty and fire/oil to the people so that you can have separate experience for each track.
10. moats? if that's not possible, maybe some trenches? walls are too bland
11. traps or possibly oil or rocks from the walls
12. burning the forest, or fire damage to buildings and war machines
13. let me put dead bodies in front of the waves so i get them sick - lol (yes i want this so bad)

Things for improvement at this stage (The game is completely playable and enjoyable in its current state)

The campaign has a nice story line, although possibly add parts where there are reinforcements or where you can alternatively play as the peasants? Also an ""attack move"" option would be a godsend, as well as unit-grouping abilities, and queuing of multiple research projects. With research, perhaps the final tech could serve as a Civ ""future tech"" and allow you to improve efficiency when playing an endless mode. Additionally the resources are plentiful in the endless mode, but perhaps a tech would be something similar to Tropico where you can extract deeper deposits or have deep seam mines etc. for longer playthroughs.

First, the good parts: The biggest plus of this game is that it is addictingly fun. I usually wait a while after wishlisting a game, but I had such a blast with the demo that I decided to buy this at full price, and definitely feel I've gotten my money's worth in enjoyment. This game is challenging, but in my opinion does a good job of making it ""challenging but fun"" as opposed to ""infuriatingly difficult"" - when I get overrun, I don't want to ragequit, but try again and see if I can do better. It also has a nice art style, and while the tutorial doesn't show everything you can do, I've found that it's not difficult to intuit how to play this game in terms of tactics, upgrades, etc.

Now for the caveats: This is an early access game, and so the campaign mode currently only has two missions - the map indicates that there's a lot more planned, but a lookup in discussions indicates that the campaign mode will be fleshed out over the coming year. There is an endless mode to help keep you satiated before more missions are added, but do keep that in mind. Also, mileage may vary in terms of price - I feel I got my money's worth, but I can understand others being hesitant with the asking price. Also, there's still a couple of bugs. In my case, the game has been running pretty well, even though my PC is several years old and nowhere near the latest specs, but the campaign cutscenes are lacking visuals for me - just the audio and a black screen.",1645384261,1645384261,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

My hope for this game is some more complexity. Different terrains influencing the enemy for example , or special enemy units which focus on weakpoints and call the others to that point so you wanne have him dead like the torch guy in helms deep.

 I'll be happier once there are less stressful game modes so I can get the most out of all DNO has to offer.

I'd give it an overall score of 6/10 right now with a fun factor of 8/10.  This game definitely is made by RTS fans who know what is missing in the genre.

Between enemy waves you get to go and farm mobs with your army. In return you get some resources and mana points.
The game has magic - you can summon troops or attack spells.
You need to micro in early game because there are a lot of enemies and not many of your troops.
Graphics are pretty nice if you are into this simplistic style.
The hotkey scheme is pretty cool.

Things to improve: 
The interface is a bit clunky - you have to remember where things are and it's not obvious. 
No control groups - why?? You can't control group units or buildings. Maybe I didn't figure it out, but if you need to figure out ctrl groups then something is wrong.
Enemy AI is weird - they just go to the first unit that they agro on and then just keep chasing it. Good for kiting, 
Waves aren't done well. You don't know in advance where the waves will be coming from and you only get warning 2 minutes in advance. So you can't build proper defences in your first run of the mission. If that is done to inflate game time or just poor design I don't know, but it needs to be fixed. In Stronghold you see atack locations from the start of the mission - that is how it should be.
Resource income is not shown in any obvious location - do I need more food gatherers? Do I need more wood cutters? Who knows.
Waypoint placements don't work properly. It needs to work like in StarCraft 2. 
Loading and unloading of troops into towers doesn't work properly. Again - look how it works in SC2.

This game for some reason feels a bit more fun then the other ones. Not sure why, maybe because it feels like you can build a big army too potentially.

2, this game does not utilize GPU and multi core processing very well. In late game massive battles, when the game starts to get laggy; my 16 core cpu is only under 25% load and 50% load for my GPU. I'm sure you guys can do so much better.

Edit: After about 8 additional hours of gameplay I want to come back and add to my review. My initial review was after only beating the first campaign mission. After playing some more, I managed to beat the second campaign mission on the medium difficulty, it was really hard and took many attempts. There are currently only 2 campaign missions and an endless mode, which I was disappointed to figure out. As others have stated, I feel like this game is a bit too difficult, and requires too much micromanagement. You have to stay as focused as possible the entire time you are playing to have even a chance at success, it is not a casual experience. I don't know if that's the Devs intent or not, but I'd prefer a more casual experience IMO. I wish their was a sandbox mode, I'd like to play around with more of the later game stuff without having to grind really hard to get to that point. 

I still do recommend the game as I think it'll be really good in the future, but do keep in mind right now it is early access so it has flaws.",1645060741,1645216948,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
110392186,76561198152308874,0,1,1650,0,548,1645625089,english," I've played this game for 8.6 hours in 2 days. That says about the enjoyment of the game. if I get bored of a game, i drop it almost completely.

Good things about the game:
1. The game overall just feels nice. It is hard to describe any other ways. You have points where you can just get into the game and forget time exists. It is satisfying seeing you build up your city/town and start to really scale up.
2. The overall game feels sort of complete already but with flaws (I will get to that later) the combat feels good and the building is intuitive.

Bad things about the game:
1. The game is difficult. Like very difficult. Especially if you went the traitor route in the campaign (It isn't a spoiler, it happens super early in the campaign) the build cost of buildings seems pretty expensive for whatever you wanna build. When I first got the game, i was under the impression that I would be able to build a massive stronghold with a sizeable army to combat the horde of enemies that appear over the horizon. However, it didn't really seem the be the case. If I spend too many resources on scaling, then I wouldn't have the resources to build on the castle and army. If I were to spend too many resources on the castle, then i wouldn't have enough resources to scale up food, wood, stone, iron production. That would in turn affect my army development. So basically, if you try to focus on any aspect, then you would fall behind in others. Additionally, the enemy waves scale very hard. The first 1 -4 waves are pretty easily discombobulated. then all of a sudden, you'll get a huge enemy army charging at you that you had no idea to expect. This is especially evident in the campaign. The first couple of waves are pretty easy. Then the final wave, they will send multiple large armies from multiple directions and by then, your army is pretty lackluster compared to the sheer brute force the enemy is bring to bare. 
2. You sometimes get that one or 2 enemies that hide among your crowd of citizens and they just have a murder spree as your citizens won't run away and just casually stand there like it's another Tuesday. So that will just cause a ton of your citizens to die and then you have to pick up their bodies and etc. It's pretty tedious. But I also understand that raiding parties are a thing and that I should be ready for it.
3. Production is slow. Like very slow. You would think a Farm would be able to output massive amounts of food considering the amount of land they occupy, but it seems to be more time, resource, and space efficient to just spam fruit pickers when you are down bad on food. Furthermore, because production is slow, you don't have nearly the amount of resources to be able to build up to anything you can imagine. This is just my two cents, but if the costs of buildings was lowered and the production speed was higher, then it'll allow the player a lot more freedom to build up their castle.
4. Weird bugs. There are sometimes weird bugs that are present in the game. For example, I was under attack and I was attempting to spam walls to slow down the onslaught while I moved my army into position to fight. However, I noticed  that I had no control over my army. I couldn't move them and that resulted in my defeat.

Overall, I actually really enjoy the game, but there are some thing that I would like to tweak to make the game play slightly more player friendly. I am playing on easy for the most part and I still get dumpstered by the AI.

Im 33 i do not care to just play sandbox modes and from what i can see a lot of games are like OH play our sandbox mode for 1000 hrs then in maybe 5 years you can play the story.... How about no, im good. im going to delete this game and maybe check it out in 2-3 years if the devs deiced to drop the story and that's a strong maybe i'm sure by then someone else will make something

Update:10-15-24
   The game is now ready for launch and to be played the way it should be played with a story after so long i can give this game a thumbs up. ",1645052325,1729027771,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,True

There are little things they have to change/balance but i think it will be do more fun in the future :)
Before you buy: the capagne is only about 2 missions BUT they are working on it. The story is with a sense of humor - that's nice

The FPS are twitching sometimes or just dont wanna go over 40 fps but that's mostly only when i'm playing in endless mode and i'm on day XXX (my PC Specs: Gigabyte OC 3060ti + i5 10600KF (watercooled) + 16GB RAM) and i'm playing with a 27"" Monitor on 2560x1440px

Some things have to balance a bit like, the coming of resources for stone and iron.

Thoughts:
-------------
Pro experiences:
I have enjoyed what their I have played so far with the game.  The story cut scenes and the dialog text in them are fun and sets up each level so far.  I enjoy that you can switch to rebel side and seems like can go after king (not sure since story missions are still be worked).  I like the art style and the animations of the units.  Something about the simple looks just gets me and i enjoy it.  The building aspect is nice and simple to and no need to expand power grids or anything crazy like in their are billions.  An resource gathering as a whole is alright-ish.    Can't talk to much about tech since I never left keep level two during my story play progressions.  

Cons:
1. Game is short.. like really short unless your playing endless mode.
2. Unit control is a bit frustrating.  You move your units and they form up in formations, which is fine.. but not when i want them to attack move into something.  I just want a attack move option to attack anything in path up to location I told them to go...
3. Resources are a pain.  Quarries, Mines, and Fishing sites, feel like they mine out too fast.  Also feels like we get to little lumber for how fast we can deplete the forest.  

The hmmm:
1. Maps.  All the maps are randomly generated, even mission ones.  So if your having troubles just start the mission over.  If you get a map you like make sure to save it and make a copy of the save file.  In case you wipe. because your next map may have go defense locations but no resources in good areas.  Could be a map with all resources but no defensive points.  Its just random what you get and I'm not sure the ratio for how game determines stone and iron mine sites or how many berry or fish spots to put in.",1645026711,1645026711,True,1,0,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,True

To elaborate i find that ranged units if set to attack an enemy through a wall will attempt to walk around instead of getting closer to the wall to shoot over, this can cause some frustration especially when you are fighting against waves of enemies coming in all directions . For a game that has just released into early access i'm happy with the results so far.

What doesn't help is that the Steam store page hides this fact behind a ""read more"" button, which lulls people into thinking that the game is even remotely in a good enough state for even a partial release. Not to mention that the ""normal"" difficulty level is so extremely high, which generally mean that you will blast past the maximum 2 hours for a refund.

My advice? Go and download the demo, as the full early access ""campaign"" literally contains just one more map than the demo.

I will say there does seem to be a discrepancy between difficulties. Where one is the ""chill"" version and the other is ""WTF hard"". The hardest difficulty I just don't wanna even know right now.

The game is overall fun and aesthetically pleasing and pretty straightforward as far as this style of games go. There are variety of resources to gather which I like. I feel like some games only have one or two and the economy just gets boring. However there are some quality of life issues that I'm honestly having trouble getting past.

Problem #1 - As far as I know there doesn't seem to be an economy ""tab"" I can open that shows my net gain/loss. Its really only an issue with food tbh. It shows what you consume the next day but not what you are harvesting. In resource management games (which this IS 110%) efficiency is honestly life or death otherwise you're just guessing at how much food, wood, stone, etc you are getting each day. Do I need 3 berry picking huts or can I squeeze by with 2? Well hell if I know. You also can't build structures unless you have the people to staff them. Doesn't matter if you have the wood. Which wouldn't be so bad if I knew whether I needed 2 or 3 berry huts, so I can free up those workers. Get it? There are ways around this but it's extra steps that can all be avoided with just one simple thing....an Economy Tab for an economy game.

Problem #2 - Spawns in Endless Mode. Sometimes you get a GODLY spawn and you want for nothing. However sometimes they really screw you and the game is already challenging enough that if you get a bad spawn, you just start shaking your head and asking why me?! You're in the middle of a damn field with no food but berries and no natural barriers to aid in wall building and choke points. Good luck getting the resources to build all those walls. Sucker.

Now having said all that I am enjoying this game, mostly because I'm still learning and I haven't hit a progression wall. I'm holding out for these things to be fixed. In the meantime I'm going to keep playing to see if maybe I can win despite it. However at the current state of the game and the current price tag, I just don't think I can recommend it. Drop the price or add an economy tab. Then I'll change my mind.

Edit 3/29/22 - Oh please fix the catapult aggro. They DO NOT attack the nearest target. I have lost early game playthroughs WAY too many times because it attacks a huge cluster of enemies at the max range pulling a huge mob when I already have a mob attacking my troops i.e. ""the nearest target"".",1644994474,1648593226,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,True

The first level is great and teaches you the main mechanics of the game. It's challenging but not impossible. But then you play the 2nd level, and the difficulty level spikes up way too drastically. It's not bad to fail a level a few times before you get it right, but because the level layouts are random it's RNG on whether you'll get a good start and also means it's very difficult to plan and learn from each failure. The levels also take just long enough to get to the final wave that when you fail it feels like a huge waste of time.
There's also much needed QoL that needs to be added to the game, like a way to find idle units or being able to jump to units/buildings/civs under attack.

Nearby areas are infested with enemies that you need to fight and clear out. As you expand your footprint, you also need to expand your defenses to protect your resource production.

There's only two campaign missions right now but they are fun and the cut-scenes have some decent humor. After that you have to play endless mode which is where most of my time is right now. It's good for a good chunk of fun time but there are some issues that come up.

Difficulty scaling is the biggest issue in my opinion. The lowest difficulty is okay but feels slightly too easy. So your first reaction is to go to the medium difficulty and maybe that'll be perfect right? Wrong. The medium difficulty is easily 3x+ as hard as the lower one and personally is quite unfun to me. And if you get a mediocre map on top of that just call it quits and restart. There needs to be a balance on the medium difficulty for endless or a 4th difficulty option set between the two. 

Late game when the screen starts to flood with enemies the game will lag and stutter especially if you zoom out, and if you use the fast forward mods you are likely to crash. Not a hardware issue just an optimization issue with that many enemies. However before you get to that absurd point the game does run amazing to me. There are some bugs such as the game not leaving the grid/build mode unless you open it again and place or left click on an object, but otherwise nothing that's more than even a slight inconvenience. 

At $25 the game in it's current state may be slightly over priced, but I have thoroughly enjoyed my time so far. If you're a major fan of this genre or catch it on sale I'd say grab it. I'm looking forward to see where the game goes from here.",1644954976,1644954976,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

An overarching sense of claustrophobia from both the nearby enemy camps and the need to build compactly to make sure that you can consolidate your defence forces for the final attack. This is different to other settlement building games where extensively sprawling out is a requirement to becoming strong. That being said, you will need to dip your toes into the wilderness as you deplete resources nearby. This makes it all the more tense and exciting. The developers may need to make tweaks to the difficulty settings if they want to facilitate players that want an easy ride, but I personally love the challenge. Some waves that show up make me think 'Are you serious!?' but I like being kept on my toes. The narrative at the start of each campaign mission is amusing and a bit weird, and could do with speeding up at times, but shows promise for some wild & silly stories as they add more missions.

- Very fun to build your city, arm massive towers with trebuchets and archers.
- Wave system keeps tension high and its a constant struggle to replenish your resources as resource nodes can run out.
- Aesthetics are nice
- Somewhat nice variety in units, archers, swordsman, catapults, horseman etc

Some bad considerations:

- Some UI elements are very bad, especially the notification system when some of your buildings are attacked
- Low on content, only 2 campaign missions and an endless mode(which is fun).
- Map generation is kinda bad, since you can get a map which has considerably bad choke points and resources.
- Some people are reporting performance trouble in later waves with large amounts of enemies, I haven't personally noticed this.

If you want an easier game, you should probably wait a few months until full release when they add even easier game mode.

With this I simply want to jump right back in to try to do better.

I will say a lot of your success feels like RNG, since the maps are procedurally generated you'll feel like your getting steam rolled 2 or 3 times before you get your footing or get a good map with a lot choke points. It's also still in very Early Access, I was disappointed to see the big beautiful campaign map only to realize only 2 missions are currently available. However the endless mode has kept me plenty preoccupied, and I look forward to seeing where the game goes from here.

EDIT: It has now been just over 2 years since I posted this review, and while I have enjoyed my time with the game and the dev's have worked hard to continue to improve and refine the horde modes and game play loop, I can't help but admit I become extremely dissapointed with the lack of any (playable) progress on the campaign.  The dev's have been saying continually that they just need more time, and they don't want to release it until its ready, but then why did the game launch with the first 2 missions if the plan was to wait until the entire campaign was done to release anything else? 

I will still keep my review positive, but at this time I would say buy it if you're okay with different horde-mode repayable matches. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE PROMISE OF A CAMPAIGN. Buy it for what it is and you'll be happy, but I do not have faith in the devs to deliver any campaign for the foreseeable future.",1644895535,1712269452,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game provokes you to spam soldiers asap leaving you with slow resource income for better and stronger buildings/defences in the long run unless you spam houses which will only cause food issues. Resources are finite so your forced to expand leaving some areas undefended while you prepare.

I'm  fine with early access,  really.   It's been nice seeing the Devs throw together a roadmap, and say they're still there, and yadda yadda.  End of the day though, this is for sale at (near) it's full price at the time of review.    

They clearly have a  goal in mind, and want to get there,  but in its current itteration, no.   What's wrong?  Well.

1 - Procedural Generation -  Every map is.  The campaign is massive  there's  a giant map.  Every single mission is procedurally generated.    You might have an amazing start that's very defensable.  You might have a start with almost no wood or stone.   Who knows!  

2 - Imbalanced Economy -   Everything just costs far too much.  Units don't.  They're cheap as beans.   But a single segment of wooden wall (the lowest, most basic wall)  4 units of wood.   Your wood cutters make that in about 10 seconds.    

Not just raw material, but time as well. Everything takes a long time to make.  Wanna upgrade your buildings,  even more time.   Additional bulders huts would help...right?   Well...yes.  But you have to build those too instead of other buildings you pressingly need.      By your Leveld up town hall if you don't have enough stone stock piled  how will you upgrade anyway?     Oh, someone died?  Better spend some prescious resources on a graveyard then,   Oh and you wanna upgrade your units too?    

Way too much time and cost. If you don't go into it with a stupid greed based build order  and a RNG map roll (because remeber, they're all procedural)  doesn't matter, you're done.  Because

3 - The UI Sucks -   More specifically feedback about what's going on.    After a while groups of mobs will start just...walking on into your base.   If you don't have a walls,  it's over.  Just reset,  they'll overwhelm you.   ""can't you just move your army there?""  Well...yes,  until a attack wave comes.  If you've managed to build up  a large enough force to split it,  you might survive,  maybe.      But what's attacking me now....?  

The minimap will not help you. The single dood smacking your building....he's somewhere.   It flashed a little mark and a guys yelling at me that it's happening, but I don't.  seee him?  Any archers nearby?  No?  OH there it is.  

4 - Difficulty Scaling -  This sorta falls into the lack of feedback and the Eco being so wonky.  But it really is difficult,  even on the medium setting.    Not rewarding difficult,  unfair difficult.  It's not  ""get good""  it's  ""Get lucky""   You can tell very eary on if a run is gonna be good or not simply by map generation.   Once you do get a,  favourable map...you then need to play hard and constant.  Always expanding resources,   army etc,  there's no ""turtling""  it's very hectic and actually quite active.  Which is nice,  sorta.      Issues arrise because of the aforementioend raids and overinvestment in time and Eco.  The second anything falls out of balance,  it's over.   


FTL is a more forgiving game than this.  

I've not actually experienced  -too- much FPS drops.   So that isn't something I can comment on,  but read reviews, watch gameplay and make your own mind up.   It's clearly not going to be going anywhere.    

Will they fix it?   Probably.  Probably very likely they will,

Very early days but I like it. It's like Stronghold meets They Are Billions, which is interesting. The art style isn't bad, the gameplay is pretty straightforward (build an economy, build walls and troops, survive waves of enemies) but rewards good play and brutally punishes bad play.

Right now there's two campaign levels, although I imagine we'll see more rapidly. The difficulty is tuned fairly high; when you make mistakes you'll suffer. At the same time, I was able to recover from fairly disastrous waves quickly without a cascade of failures which isn't the case in many similar games. 

Like I said, at the moment it is absolutely 100% not worth paying 25 dollars for, at all. Like I said, two campaign levels.

-The pacing of the game is very well done, with the player being incentivized to spend a fair amount of time on each town hall level to build up economy and defenses. Each level has meaningful jumps in power and production if you take the time to invest in them 
-The unit variety is decent for a game like this, and I can say every unit makes sense at some point in the game. 
-Economy looks simple on the surface, but actually has a bit of depth. Between the productivity boosting buildings you get late in the game, and location of storages to minimize travel time, to upgrading structures, there is a lot going on here.
-Simplistic magic system. Four spells, you unlock more as you upgrade a certain structure. Each has a use, but I wish there was more to it. 
-Very clever upgrade mechanic, with useful upgrades that boost just about every aspect of you ability to build and defend. 
-Clever city management mechanics, albeit at a very surface level. I think this is the weaker part of the game, with the disease/grave mechanic being easily ignorable if you play well enough. 
-Humor in the campaign got me more than once. Very dry, I love it. 
-Enemy variety is fairly basic, but oh dear is there a lot of em. 
-Good pacing in terms of the map. You have to build an offensive part of your army, because so much is gated on going out and killing rebel camps/buildings. 

The campaign is very short, and a lot of mechanics still need a bit of work, but overall, I think this is very promising, and the devs are VERY receptive to feedback. There was a small difficulty balance patch on day one or two, so seems very good on that front. 

I think the devs have what it takes to make this a great game, and I am willing to invest a bit more based on how promising the demo and game are now. If you don't think so, wait for a sale. I, however, very much enjoy it now, and wholeheartedly recommend it.

It's a classic premise executed well.  You start small with little resources and have to build up to prevent bigger and stronger waves of enemies from destroying your point of control.

Maps are proceduraly generated, and contain a mix of open areas, forests, and mountains.  Mountains impeded attacker's way and are vital in defending your base early on.  The game runs well, even with thousands of units on the screen at once.

The sound and music are all pleasant and clear, and give good indicators, though occasionally the warning voice gets a bit annoying telling you what's happening over and over again while you watch it happen on the screen.  The UI is clean and easy to understand, and unit path-finding is generally good.  Occasionally unit commands need to be repeated as they don't always take on the first click.  Enemy AI always seems to find a terrible spot to attack your defences.  The enemy AI is also single minded, blindingly attacking the closest defence or unit.  The one major issue the UI lacks, is visual indicators of attacks, and it's size make it almost unreadable.  I'd often find myself spending 2 to 3 minutes with my face close to the screen scanning for the individual red pixel on the mini-map signifying a single enemy that if left untouched can quickly destroy vital buildings, people and resources in my camp.

As you are attacked in waves, you'll build up a city and defences, and most of the city building works well.  A couple of items that you may run into is resources spawning with no way to fit in a mine or fishery next to them to gather, or the need of people to run the building constantly running out.  On that note, you only gain new workers at the start of the day, based on how many houses you have, if you're houses are under construction when the unannounced morning begins, you'll find yourself short of people, and often unable to build vital resources.  This occasionally makes the game sluggish, and it's difficult to time when to build certain items as you need to self-time them.

The difficulty scale levels quickly, too quickly compared to your ability to defend, and you'll often find yourself out of luck even in the earliest waves of enemies.  In my time with the game, and having survived 14 waves and 50 days in survival mode, I have yet to even be able to fully make use of the top tier buildings and units. Wave timings also appear to be irregular, and often times don't give you any time to repair and rebuild, even in some of the early waves. In between waves, you'll also be attack by, you got it, waves of enemies in small numbers that spawn out of nothing in the distance to attack you at the worse time, with no prior indications.  You'll also need to sweep the are around you to crystals to use powerful magic spells, but the crystals are limited and there is no way to replenish once you've cleared the area.  Both of these items cause quite a bit of frustration as the major waves themselves are enough of a challenge to prepare for. A bit of balancing on wave timing, magic resources and the other random waves of enemies would help here.  

The campaign also doesn't help you out here, launching you into a full scale war with little guidance.  A separate tutorial is available, but it's not enough to train you for the necessary build orders and speed required for even the first level of the campaign.

* Campaign only has 2 maps - i was really disappointed.
* Campaign maps are just normal maps, i expected to play hand crafted maps and take over command of a town or a city to defend.
* Performance issues in late game endless mode, even with high end pc game starts to freeze and crash. Made it to day 100 in ""easy"" mode.
* No way to generate crystals? Thats bad, i would like to see some mechanic, e.g. religion / worth shipping a statue to generate crystals
* Enemies should set up camps before the attack and if you attack it and destroy parts of it or completly the enemy wave wont be that strong
* When two or more buildings are selected a promt is needed when you want to delete them. Currently it is way to easy to delete all your buildings
* Archers on walls are highly inefficient to place. A mass place mode for connected walls is needed.
* Building ON rocks should be possible and also very expensive.
* Rivers and bridges would be cool.
* Forester should be available one castle level earlier.
* Cavalery should be able to run down enemies in the inital charge. Maybe upgrade to use lance and not sword.
* I would like to play the other side and siege a city / castle.
* More upgrades, more research and more defense mechanics would also be great.
* I am missing tactics and strategies. The game is a bit shallow. Wall up, build towers, build mechanics workshop and shoot everything with catapult and such.

Edit1:
* A wizzard and/or a saucerer would be great. Wizzards attack from back line with spells. Saucerer uses buffs and debuffs.


Edit2:

* Food and wood generation are self suffient in mid and late game which is great. You still have to expend the base for stone and iron.

Played the tutorial which is quite OK.

Started playing the campaign. First mission on medium difficulty is just a walk in the park.

Playing mission two for four hours now. Even on easiest difficulty its unbeatable. Thanks to mission two I cannot refund anymore due to exceeting the two hours limit of Steam.

Additionally game is extremly dull and boring. Everything takes extremly long while there´s always a time limit working against the player. Controls are completly inaccurate so you have to check back constantly. Players unit AI is a catastrophe. Some units start to attack while the rest is just standing there watching. This way enemy units can just chop down your own units bit by bit. This all leads to a frustrating high level of micromanagement of about a dozen units and buildings in total. On the other hand the gameplay lacks any kind of variation. You´re doing exactly the same thing a dozen times a minute.

And last but not least the devs want some exorbitant 20€ for this dumpster fire of a game that never saw any kind of quality management. No idea how to justify that amount of money for such a dull and annoying game.

-Sometimes micromanaging the builders gets stuck. Like I'm wandering why the builders won't build, but then I notice that I have unfinished piece of wall that the builders cant get to. So the whole building system is waiting for someone to go to that one wall piece to finish. Destroying that element fixes the problem, but if you don't spot it early your buildings won't finish on time
-Upgrading town hall to lvl3 is bit too expensive. It will drain the whole defense budget

As you can see I played 17 hours and enjoyed every moment.
It was little hard to get in, but the humor helped.

A bit of comment/suggestion here: 
1. the citizens can be a bit more personalised, instead of just assigning work forces, would be great to randomise names for them, and be able to check where they are. 
2. As the path finding of the game is really interesting, sometimes a building shows the resident is stuck somewhere not able to reach the work place and i cant spot the resident.
3. with smaller units like individual soldiers or even catapults it's okay that they lump together when they get recruited, but because the hitbox of the trebuchets are so large when they are spawned and stuck together it happened to me that they kind of squeeze into each other and launched one of them away. So alternatively making the spawn spot not a single spot but a row or even an area would make the troops look much nicer.
4. enemy catapult count is off the roof in late game in endless. once you pass the tenth wave, you get a giant wave of catapult after the soldiers. maybe substitute 10 for a trebuchet or balista? the catapults don't really do much to walls but they are all piled together looking very weird",1644669273,1644669273,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The Campaign is NOT worth bothering with at this time. I made it to the second what looked like at least a dozen towns. The final wave seems intended to kill you so that you don't know, in game, that there is only TWO campaign missions. The story scenes feel... dull, but at least it is a plot of sorts that might make for an interesting campaign later.

The random maps make it impossible to plan strategies and resources when you lose and have to try again. Even though I was on the easiest difficulty the resource management made it feel like it was intended to starve my advancement arbitrarily rather than making for fun player choices. I like random maps if it feels like I have the flexibility to deal with an excess of one map feature and a near lack of the other. The problem is, the balance is so tightly defined that anything but a perfect map or expert execution will punish you without chance for recovery.

That said, this game has a lot of *potential* to be fun. The systems and structure of the game work nicely, the ramping up is too high on the enemies and the resources for the players are too limited to allow a fun progression for the player, but at least the genre and the graphics are nice.

Edit: I suppose I could say, recommend with caveats. The lack of campaign content still bugs me and, for me, the difficulty is still a bit too unpleasantly punishing, but for folks who like grueling survive the wave style of games, I guess it's a good pick seeing as the developers are doing great at listening to players and adding updates and the endless mode is quite playable even now.",1644640618,1646948748,False,19,2,0.614281654357910156,0,True,False,True

=== ข้อมูลเบื้องต้น ===

มาอีกแล้วกับเกมแนวตระกูล TAB กล่าวโดยย่อคือเราจะมีสิ่งก่อสร้างหลัก(ปราสาท)เกิดอยู่กลางแมพ ซึ่งเราก็ต้องเก็บรวบรวมทรัพยากร สร้างสิ่งก่อสร้างขยายฐานออกไปเรื่อยๆจากศูนย์กลาง คอยสร้างทหารและวิจัยพัฒนาสิ่งก่อสร้างใหม่ โดยทั้งฉากเริ่มมาจะมีศัตรูกระจายอยู่รอบๆทั่วไปหมด เราสร้างทหารมาไล่ยึดพื้นที่ในฉากเพื่อตัวเองจะได้ขยายไปได้ โดยเกมจะให้เราตั้งรับการบุกเป็นระลอก(เป็นเวฟ) โดยที่ระลอกสุดท้ายจะจัดหนักจัดเต็มที่สุดแบบศัตรูทะลักมาทั่วทุกสารทิศ หากเรายังสามารถตั้งรับเอาตัวรอดได้ก็คือชนะ

เกมตระกูลนี้คนที่เคยเล่น RTS จะรู้สึกว่าเข้าใจได้ง่ายมาก เป็นลักษณะสร้างของบางสิ่งเพื่อปลดล็อคบางสิ่งหรืออัพเดทสิ่งที่มีอยู่เดิม และก็ปั๊มทหารออกไปไล่กวาดศัตรู แต่แม้ว่าเข้าใจได้ง่ายก็ยากที่จะเชี่ยวชาญ เพราะเกมแนวนี้มักมากับความยากแบบเกรียนๆซึ่งอาจทำให้คนที่ไม่เคยชินกับตระกูล colony survival เบือนหน้าหนีได้ง่ายๆ (เกมยากแต่ก็ยังมีความแฟร์ในระดับที่เอาชนะได้) แต่หากคุณเป็นคนที่คิดว่าความยากในระดับกำลังดีคือรสชาติแห่งความท้าทาย เกมตระกูลนี้เป็นสิ่งที่คุณต้องมาลองเล่นไล่เรียงไปทีละเกมแน่นอน

เกมเลือก setting เป็นยุคปี 1491 ซึ่งเป็นช่วงท้ายๆของยุคมืดหรือยุคกลางในยุโรป (medieval age) ซึ่งยุโรปส่วนใหญ่ใช้ระบบการปกครองแบบศักดินาสวามิภักดิ์ (feudalism) ในโลกแห่งความจริงก็มีเหตุการณ์ในปีนี้เรียกว่า Bread and Cheese Revolt มีชาวนาลุกฮือขึ้นต่อต้านการเก็บภาษี โดยฆ่าเจ้าหน้าที่เก็บภาษีและบุกเข้าปล้นทำลายปราสาทสองหลังในฮอลแลนด์ ในเกมนี้ก็...เอิ่ม...ใช่ครับ เราเล่นเป็นขุนนาง (lord) คนนึงที่ต้องมารับมือกับกองทัพกบฏชาวนาที่แห่แหนมาจากทั่วทุกสารทิศนั่นเอง ใน campaign จะมีเนื้อเรื่อง+ด่านต่างๆมากมาย ทั้งนี้เมื่อเข้าด่านสองเราสามารถเลือกได้ด้วยว่าจะทำตามหน้าที่ของตัวเองหรือเลือกไปอยู่ฝ่ายชาวบ้าน (ซึ่งจะทำให้เกมที่มันยากอยู่แล้วยากขึ้นไปอีก)

อย่าลืมว่าตัวเกมเป็น early access มีแค่โหมด endless กะ campaign ซึ่งแคมเปญเองแม้ว่าดูแผนที่แล้วน่าจะมีเป็นสิบๆด่าน แต่ตอนนี้ก็ยังเล่นได้แค่ 3 ด่าน (ยังทำแคมเปญไม่เสร็จ) รูปแบบภารกิจก็ยังเห็นรูปแบบเดียว แต่ระบบหลายๆอย่างก็ถือว่าสนุกและเริ่มลงตัว มี quality of life ที่ดีระดับนึง 

=== เปรียบเทียบกับ They are billions ===

- บรรยากาศต่างกันโดยสิ้นเชิง อันนี้ดูสดใสมากกว่าโดยเป็นแนวธรรมชาติๆ ศัตรูหลักคือกบฏชาวนา (ไม่ใช่ซอมบี้ในยุคโลกล่มสลาย) ใครที่บ่นๆว่าใน TAB หรือ age of darkness บรรยากาศดูหม่นๆทะมึนๆ มีแต่ซอมบี้/ปีศาจ/สัตว์ประหลาด ก็น่าจะชอบบรรยากาศที่ดูสดใสกว่าในเกมนี้ ส่วนการหมุนมุมกล้องก็ทำได้อิสระ โดยกราฟฟิคเป็นมนุษย์ก๊องแก๊งคล้ายๆ totally accurate battle simulator แต่รวมๆดูสวยงามทันสมัยกว่า TAB ที่ออกไปคล้ายๆแนว retro+steampunk

- ระบบกลางวันกลางคืนที่ยังไม่เห็นว่ามันมีผลอะไรเท่าไหร่ แค่ 1.ทุกเช้าจะได้คนงานใหม่ตามจำนวนที่อยู่อาศัยรองรับ 2.คนจะกินอาหาร (อาหารถูกหักจากยุ้งฉาง) หากอาหารไม่พอคนก็จะป่วย ประสิทธิภาพการผลิตลดลงหรืออาจม่องไปเลย 3.เวฟมาตามที่นับถอยหลัง

- การเก็บเกี่ยวทรัพยากรจะมีการขนไปเท ไม่ใช่ตัวเลขบวกลอยๆ ยกตัวอย่างเช่น สร้างกระต๊อบเก็บผลไม้ คนงานจะเดินไปเก็บตามพุ่ม หากพุ่มหมดก็จะย้ายไปเก็บพุ่มอื่นต่อ สุดท้ายเอาทรัพยากรไปเทที่ปราสาทหรือยุ้งฉางจึงจะนับ ไม่ใช่ระบบบวกลอยแบบ TAB หรือ AoD ที่คำนวณตัวเลขแบบให้ทรัพยาตามหน่วยเวลา (10ไม้/8ชั่วโมง อะไรแบบนี้ ซึ่งTABไม่เคยมีคนออกไปตัดไม้จริง แต่เกมนี้มีคนเดินออกไปโค่นต้นไม้ ดังนั้นป่าจะหายไปเรื่อยๆ) แต่การสร้างนู่นนี่ยังเป็นการหักอัตโนมัติจากสิ่งที่เรามีเหมือนกัน (เช่น ไม่ต้องขนไม้ไปวางเพื่อสร้าง) ดังนั้นคุณต้องคิดด้วยว่าจะวางผังเมืองยังไงให้มีประสิทธิภาพ

- ไม่มีระบบ chain reaction ตรงนี้ถือว่าง่ายกว่า TAB (หรือมองอีกแง่อาจเพราะมันคือระบบที่ unique เฉพาะ TAB นั่นแหละ) หากแต่ชาวนาที่ใช้แค่คราดโง่ๆในเกมนี้ก็ดันทำลายสิ่งก่อสร้างได้เร็วใช้ได้

- สร้างฐานที่ไหนก็ได้ ไม่ต้องสร้างเสาไฟเหมือน TAB (ก็สิ่งก่อสร้างยุคกลางมันไม่ใช้ไฟฟ้าอะนะ) หากแต่ว่าการสร้างเป็นระบบที่เราสั่งสร้างปุ๊บยังต้องรอคนงาน(เดินอืดอาด)มาตอกจนกว่าสิ่งก่อสร้างจะเสร็จด้วย ไม่ใช่กดวางปุ๊บมันจะค่อยๆงอกขึ้นมา

- ขยายฐานได้ง่ายกว่าเดิมเพราะไม่มีลูป [สร้างฟาร์ม>อาหาร>สร้างบ้าน>คนงาน>ฟาร์ม...] เกมนี้คุณสามารถปั๊มคนเป็นร้อยได้ในไม่กี่วัน เพราะสามารถสร้างบ้านไปก่อนได้ไม่มีขีดจำกัด(แค่ตามจำนวนไม้ที่มี) ส่วนคนงานจะมาทุกรุ่งเช้าและจะมีการกินอาหารเฉพาะตอนรุ่งเช้าเท่านั้น ดังนั้นถ้าคุณจัดสรรอาหารสำรอง(หรือหาเสริมได้ไว)จะสามารถขยายประชากรได้ไว ทำให้รู้สึกมีอะไรต้องทำตลอด ไม่ควรปล่อยให้เวลาสูญเปล่า

- ทรัพยากรหลายอย่างเป็นแบบใช้แล้วหมดไป เช่น เก็บไม้มีการโค่นต้นไม้จริง ดังนั้นป่าจะค่อยๆหายไป เหมืองหินเหมืองเหล็กก็มีวันใช้จนหมด

- ลืมไปได้เลยกับการหา choke point เพราะเกมนี้มันแทบไม่มี เหมือนเป็นที่เปิดโล่งแทบทั้งแมพ (ป่าก็เดินทะลุได้) ดังนั้นเมื่อเล่นๆไปสิ่งที่จะเกิดขึ้นคือการล้อมฐานด้วยกำแพงเมืองจีนยาวเหยียดนับร้อยลี้

- ไม่มีป้อมยิงอัตโนมัติ การป้องกันหลักคืออาศัยเอาทหารที่เรามีไปประจำการตามประตู/กำแพง/หอคอย (คล้าย stronghold พิกล) ตรงนี้ถือว่ายากกว่า TAB แต่ก็ไม่แน่ว่าอนาคตอาจเพิ่มมาให้ล่ะนะ

- เลือกระดับความยากได้หลากหลาย แม้ว่าจะมีระดับความยากแค่ 3 ระดับ(ซึ่งระดับสุดท้ายถือว่าเดือดดีมากแล้ว) แต่การที่ในเคมเปญมันสามารถเลือกได้ว่าจะอยู่ฝ่ายพระราชาหรือฝ่ายชาวนา การเลือกฝ่ายชาวนานี่แหละทำให้สามารถขยายความยากออกไปได้อีก (ซึ่งเลือกเล่นฝ่ายชาวนาแบบยากสุดคือเดือดมาก)

=== สรุป ===

++ ง่ายต่อการเรียนรู้และเข้าถึง ใครชอบแนว Colony survival ควรจัดมาลองอย่างยิ่ง ไม่ต้องคิดมาก ยิ่งชอบ TAB ยิ่งต้องลอง

+ Quality of life ทำออกมาได้ดีใช้ได้ / ตั้ง custom key สำหรับผู้ชื่นชอบการใช้ hotkeys ได้ / มีคัทซีนตามเนื้อเรื่องที่มีอารมณ์ขันแบบเกรียนๆ / ตัวเลือกความยากที่หลากหลาย

+/- ยังเป็น early access แม้ว่าหลายๆอย่างต้องรออัพเดทโดยเฉพาะแคมเปญ แต่ตอนนี้ก็ถือว่ามีศักยภาพที่จะเติบโตเป็นเกมที่ยอดเยี่ยมในอนาคต (แถมราคาโคตรถูก)

- รูปแบบภารกิจยังมีชนิดเดียว / ต้องรอดูว่าจะมีตัวเลือกในแคมเปญที่มีผลต่อแนวทางการเล่นไหม เช่น อัพ tech หรือ perk ในแคมเปญเพื่อให้แนวทางการเล่นไม่ซ้ำเดิม เพราะหากไม่มีพอเล่นไปนานๆย่อมสามารถจำลำดับและรูปแบบการออกสิ่งก่อสร้างได้ ไม่มีอะไรให้ต้องพลิกแพลงมาก",1644627029,1644708625,True,3,1,0.496170878410339355,0,True,False,True

I'm not overly familiar with games like they are billions etc. so when i got my ass handed to me, I assumed it was due to missing experience with this type of game. Turned down the difficulty and got swamped even more. tried several times on several difficulties and no change.

The maps are randomly generated, so naturally the difficulty is as well. Whether or not you get access to natural choking points, such as cliffs or water, is up to the cointoss. Even the Campaign maps are fully random. I'm not sure how the devs are guiding their difficulty curve if they can't be arsed to create even the Campaign maps.

Enemies come from random directions and you get very little warning time as to where they'll spawn, so reactively building up a defense is out of the question. Building up an all-purpose omnidirectional defense is also out of the question because you can't have a defending army AND generate the required ressources in time. You can build up the defense if you dedicate the entire settlement to ressource generation or you can have an army to use the defenses you had no resources to build.

On a concept level, the game is good. But it needs significant balancing passes before it plays well.

This is obviously a style of game that's been done before, but there's something compelling about fighting off waves of endless hordes. And therein lies the problem. The difficulty ramps up far more quickly than it's possible to cope with. I feel as though the game needs to be more balanced, so you're not overwhelmed by wave 4 on the easiest setting. Of course, it could just be me, and I might well be rubbish at these sort of games, but DINAO just makes it a bit too hard for me.

Graphically, well, it's what you'd expect from a game like this. Nice, neat, cute. Sound is nice, with the gruff voices of your soldiers sounding like Englishmen, which is a nice touch for an Englishman like me! Interface is fine, although I'd like to know how much food I was producing/consuming, and it would be nice if the fish regenerated over time. And the forests. Maybe through further research that kind of thing is possible. I'd like to see a larger research tree, but I think that until I can work out a reliable tactic, I'm going to be beaten by wave 4/5 every time, so that's not much time to research new tech.

I wish it was more forgiving, which would lead to longer games, and it would be great to have a massive battle combating a massive base that's been gradually constructed over waves. Nice to see a big base being torn down after a lengthy game than a small base being ripped to shreds in 15 mins.

In a similar manner with 'Billions' - you build the base, train troops, explore the map, build defenses, survive waves of enemies - before the final assault.

Art is very cute. The game runs smoothly. The story is solid - dark humor suits the narrative quite well.

It contains an endless mode and two campaign missions - further campaign missions are promised.

Graphics:
The game is gorgeous and runs well on my machine, you can scroll to a very low level of detail and it's enjoyable to watch your little peons run around doing their thing.

Gameplay: This game has 3 game modes and the experience is drastically different between them. The 'easy' game mode is the only one where as a player you can actually enjoy building up your settlement and taking time to watch battles/workers. Medium and hard scale up with limited starting resources, more regular and larger waves of enemies. If you want a challenge you will get it in spades. It can be brutal. Having to manually collect magic crystals forces you out of your turtle which is a good bonus for cowardly players like me.
HOWEVER - if you enjoy building up a settlement you risk bouncing off this game on anything other than easy as the frantic racing around the screen desperately micro-managing units in your army for peak efficiency, building specific builds in exactly the right order will leave little time for 'enjoying' the colony builder aspect. So you would be right to approach this as a medieval They Are Billions.

Content? I'm a little disappointed - the endless mode and two campaign missions feels slightly lightweight. However the game mechanics and breadth of unit types/buildings and enemies I have seen are very impressive and show an extremely sturdy start.

The mechanics are great, building up your base is a joy, it's fun to build up and use your army, and the sheer scale of the large attacks is quite incredible.

I see a lot of reviews complaining that Mission 3 (the build boats mission I assume) is a crazy difficulty spike. If you are familiar with how the resource and building system works (which is much more intuitive nowadays and you should pick it up after a couple of games), the mission shouldn't be much trouble. If you use your brain, look at the objectives, see what is required, and act accordingly. The objectives ask you to make a big army to go on the boats, so I focused on making a large army quite early rather than building fortifications, and the mission was no trouble at all.

Has speed settings (unlike TAB) and pause and reasonable zoom (unlike Age of Darkness). Its unique point is the physics simulation, which mostly means if an enemy changes speed or direction during the travel of a projectile you'll miss, shooting over obstacles will reduce accuracy and range, and if your siege engines don't have clear shots they'll often impact terrain dealing no damage to the enemy hordes. 
While zombies do exist in the game the main enemies you will defend against are actually revolting peasants who have their own siege engines, which can be interesting. 
The game has several resources of which two are infinite on the map eventually (food and wood, limited in the demo but at tier 2 you can get infinite food and tier 3 infinite wood), two are finite on the map but can be traded for (stone and iron) and one that can only be traded for (gold). The fact that tier one defenses and units as well as some tier 2 units can be recruited for only food and/or wood keep them relevant longer.
The game is somewhat buggy currently, and performance apparently is severely impacted on certain CPUs (12th gen i7s I've seen repeatedly), but in the ten hours I've played during the course of playing prior to this review I've found two; A wave spawning on an enclosed area that did not have a path to the rest of the map and the game crashing around day 42.

Gameplay - Many buildings of different levels and their purposes. Variable combat units. Tree of development of strengthenings. Excellent physical model and hence the behavior of the units. Ability to use terrain as a tactical advantage. And that's all training and the first mission. It is extremely pleasant that the main emphasis is placed on the control of troops, since only them need to be ordered, while workers are replenished daily (not always convenient, since sometimes you need to get them right now, however, on the other hand, such an implementation requires a competent expenditure of manpower ) and do everything themselves, only the construction of the necessary buildings is required.

Graphics - Very nice low-poly art with, most importantly, the ability to change the viewing angles and camera range during the game, which is sometimes extremely useful in strategies.
Music - Atmospheric and fits perfectly with the setting.

Plot - So far, only the beginning, but the plot and its presentation hooked from the first minutes. The plot itself is presented in the form of pleasant sketches between missions (similar to the briefing in Stronghold, but with graphics on the game engine). Also a separate respect to the developers for great humor.

It has a heavy focus on macro (constant building and expansion). Without decent macro skills, many of the maps can be almost impossible. Micro is also pretty important even on some of the earlier missions, where mis-microing your units leads to clumps of them dying to siege units. For a game comparison, the game is similar to They Are Billions and the devs seems to have made a few references to TAB.

During my time playing, I have not encountered any gamebreaking bugs. I have, however, encountered a few things that are mostly just inconveniences than anything. None of this substantially impacts my enjoyment of the game. The game is perfectly playable even with the issues. 

For example - There is no warning when you are deleting a building if you have selected all of the buildings of that type (or multiple using double click). Other similar games will warn you at the very least before you go about destroying several buildings.

The escape key should be adjusted to not pull up the menu until all current menus are closed. A good example of this is the research menu that fills the entire screen. Sure, I could press the 'Return' button, but I find it easier to just hit ESC, which just brings up the menu. Like I said, minor inconvenience.

Rallying units default to 'move' orders, rather than 'attack move' orders. If you put a rally point down for your barracks and spawn about 10 units, sometimes the units on the outside of that clump wont attack, because they are trying to navigate to the rally point. Additionally, units on their way to the rally point can get picked off rather easily. I have had a few cases where a unit will just walk into an enemy unit and get stuck (if i give them no other orders) and just get bludgeoned to death. 

Probably the most annoying part about this game is the pathfinding for the enemy waves. In certain circumstances, the enemies will effectively line up along chokepoints. A certain amount of going into the chokepoint is fine and expected, but I have had a few cases where if my base had water partially surrounding it, the enemies would go in a single-deep line around it. 

Unit AI - Player units will occasionally get stuck walking in place. I noticed this usually happens when they leave their post to go attack a unit and then they just get stuck on their way back. The targeting AI on some units can seem a little wonky at times, with swordsmen not always attacking the nearest unit, which leads to them walking into enemies and slowly dying. 

All in all, solid early access title. There are a few issues, but it is surprisingly feature-complete and bug-free for an early acess game.",1644515839,1644515898,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

It adds some fun new mechanics such as special player abilities (summoning dark knights is fun) without being OP. Workers need to do all the building instead of just throwing down a building.
And best of all, the game doesn't take itself overly seriously. From the more blocky art style to the humor in the (currently short) campaign.

The mechanics feel smooth for the most part for being an Early Access title, and while there are a few bugs and glitches, there's nothing game breaking.

I would suggest adding more resources to fish stone iron as its super tough on endless mode even on labirinth of pain ( i think without certain build order a lot of people can get in HUGE trouble as I have seen first gameplays). I found some bug/glitch that sometimes when i destroy enemy camp still few units spawns few secs after it so it can be a bit decisive if you moved to the town center and dont realise enemy kills your archers ( happened to me more than 10 times in 8h of gameplay), sometimes also enemies after hit with trebuchet/ catapult dissapear for a moment (looks like its no animation  when these units try to get up which also can be confusing when you push enemy further). Anyone seeing this don't even consider to not buy this game because its definitely worth to wait to fix it. As I mentioned before stone/iron could be atleast 400-500 resources as in early game is super difficult to get more places to loot these resources.

At least some of the dev team for this game are a huge help in the Unity Community, as they are active therein responding to questions therein. I bought this partially in recognition of the good work they do there and just wanted to mention it here as I felt it would be something that otherwise went unremarked on.

And for the record, the OTHER reason I bought this, is that Stronghold + They Are Billions is neat.

Diplomacy is Not An Option is great in concept. The gameplay is primarily about resource flow and making sure that you can have the resources to produce the things you need to survive as greater volumes of enemies are thrown at you. You also need to be careful about map control, as every enemy that is on the map, will eventually migrate at you during the attack waves. So if you clear the map early, you have less to deal with later. Clearing the map also rewards you with resources for summons or damage abilities. The rates of every resource are clearly marked in the UI and upgraded structures clearly signpost what cost they have for upgrading and what benefit they provide you. This is a great foundation for the game, and I have no complaints here.

I only played a few hours when I got this and I encountered 1 session breaking bug, where when some of the builder villagers died, my towncenter was incapable of making more all the sudden. There have also been a few glitches during the end of a scene, where on defeat the enemy pathing would start directing all the enemy AI to a single point nearby where they were. I believe what is happening, is that the flowfield (At least I infer it to be a flowfield based on how the AI behave) is setting some point nearby after the enemy destroy the last structure, that then all enemies converge on to form a horrendous many limbed mockery of life as the enemy entities seem to stop attempting to prevent overlap and merge into one. This is merely hilarious and not actually all that impactful as it's during the like 5-10 second end of mission screen after your last building is destroyed, but I got enough of a laugh out of it, that I wanted to mention it here.

I have found unit control to be a bit sticky for lack of a better term. Friendly entities are given more orders that then reset if they are to hold position or move to attack. So positioning a group of melee fighters between the enemy and archers in a hold ground stance, means clicking to move them, and then immediately clicking to get them to hold position when they reach their destination. Groups moved together do not form up prior to moving, so any moving in formation. Likewise since stance resets on move orders, you can click to move units in a heated moment, forget they aren't in a hold stance, and have them walk into 200 enemy entities and get pounded into dust, which is annoying. None of this is gamebreaking, but it is somewhat frustrating, and each issue kind of builds on others.

Also I'll confess I do not enjoy the laser or summoned units, or other such battlefield abilities. I get their purpose and I would say the game is balanced at higher difficulties around you using them, but I wish they were a little less fantastical. This isn't to say the setting is some kind of super serious, historic epic conforming to the historical record; but, the ion canon from the C&C series (Except instead of the GDSS Philadelphia, it's a tactical laser granted to you by the divine power of fantasy God) is a bit stark of a juxtaposition when it is presented side by side with spearmen and catapults.

So overall I only detract 1 for the session breaking bug and 2 for the control issues. It should be said that as this is an early access title, I find it likely that the control issues will be fixed with time; and, when they are fixed I will amend my score.

The only negative I can think of is that the difficulty is not as tweakable as TAB, and the maximum is likely not as hard as TAB is at max settings. The lowest difficulty is much easier than TAB for comparison's sake.
